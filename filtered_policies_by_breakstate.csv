4,Oregon,OR,Oregon Solar and Wind Easements/Rights Laws & Local Option Solar Rights Law,"Oregon has several laws that protect access to solar and wind resources andthe use of solar energy systems. Oregon's solar access laws date back to 1979and state that no person conveying or contracting to convey a property titlecan include provisions that prohibit the use of solar energy systems on theproperty. Any provisions that prohibit the use of solar energy systems arevoid and unenforceable. Solar energy systems are defined broadly to includeanything that uses solar radiation for heating, cooling, or electrical energy.In June 2011, this law was expanded upon with the passage of HB 3516. Thislegislation clarifies that in zones where residential and commercialstructures are allowed uses, solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal systemsare explicitly allowed as a permitted use. The law was further expanded in2017 with the passage of HB 2111. The legislation voids any provisions,declarations, or bylaws of a planned community which prohibit installation anduse of solar panels.    **Solar Easements:**Oregon's solar easement law was enacted in 1979; the wind easement law wasenacted in 1981.Prohibition against installation of solar panels are void and unenforceable.However, a homeowners association may adopt and enforce a provision thatimposes reasonable size, placement or aesthetic requirements for theinstallation or use of solar panels **Requirements For Creation:**  * A legal description of the real property benefited and burdened by the easement; and a description of the solar energy easement sufficient to determine the space over the burdened property which must remain unobstructed by means that shall include, but not be limited to: a sun chart showing the plotted skyline, including vegetation and structures from the perspective of the center of the lower edge of the collector surface, and a drawing showing the size and location of the collector surface being protected and its orientation with respect to true south; or a description of the solar envelope sufficient to determine the space over the burdened property that must remain unobstructed.  * The instrument creating a solar energy easement or any other access right to sunlight shall be recordable under ORS 93.710. The instrument shall be recorded in the chains of title of the benefited and burdened properties as a transfer of the easement or access right from the owner of the burdened property to the owner of the benefited property.  * When an instrument creating a solar energy easement is issued by a city or otherwise requires approval from a city, the instrument shall be attested to and contain the original signature of a city official in addition to the descriptions and chart required under subsection (1) of this section.  * An instrument creating a solar energy easement shall be indexed when recorded by the name of the city and the names of all parties claiming any interest in the real property benefited or burdened by the easement.  **Solar Access:**Oregon state law also allows municipalities and local authorities to establishsolar access laws. Access laws are intended to protect solar access to thesouth face of buildings during solar heating hours, taking into accountexisting development, vegetation, and planned uses. The local ordinances mayinclude standards for orientation of new streets and lots, placement andheight of new buildings, and the placement of new trees on public property.City and county laws are generally designed to protect south-facing roof spacefor active solar energy systems such as solar electric and solar hot waterpanels, as opposed to daylighting and passive solar heating that requiresouthern exposure to a building's wall.",Solar/Wind Access Policy,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA
13,Rhode Island,RI,Rhode Island Solar Easement Laws,"Rhode Island allows property owners to establish solar easements in the samemanner and with the same effect as a conveyance of an interest in realproperty. Solar easements must be created in writing.In general, they must include:  1. A description of the real property involved,   2. A description of the angles and three-dimensional space involved;   3. The terms under which the easement is granted or may be terminated, and  4. Any provisions for compensation of either property owner.In addition, the state’s local zoning ordinances must address access to airand light, views, and solar access.",Solar/Wind Access Policy,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA
25,Oregon,OR,Solar Water Heating Incentive Program,"**_Note: After reviewing data provided by the Energy Trust and conducting apublic comments process during summer and fall of 2014, the Oregon PublicUtilities Commission concluded that Energy Trust incentives must bediscontinued for residential and commercial solar water heating and solar poolheating measures because they are no longer passing the cost-effectivenesstests. As a result, incentives will be discontinued November 7, 2014. Read thefull announcement_**   ** _here.  _**The Energy Trust of Oregon's Solar Water Heating (SWH) Incentive Programoffers incentives to customers of Pacific Power, PGE, NW Natural Gas andCascade Natural Gas who install solar water or pool heating systems on theirhomes, office buildings, community buildings, agricultural, and municipalfacilities.

27,Iowa,IA,Iowa Solar Easement and Access Laws,"Iowa's solar access easement provision allows for access to sunlight tooperate a solar energy system. Those who are unable to obtain a voluntarysolar easement from a property owner may apply to the solar access regulatoryboard for an order granting a solar access easement if the relevant citycouncil or county board of supervisors has created such a board. In theabsence of such a board, the matter is referred to the local district court.Applications for an easement must contain specific information about the size,location, and orientation of the solar energy system as well as a descriptionof the actions that have been taken to minimize the impact on neighboringestates.    Persons, including public bodies, may voluntarily agree to create a solaraccesseasement. A solar access easement whether obtained voluntarily or pursuant totheorder of a solar access regulatory board is subject to the same recording andconveyancerequirements as other easements. A solar access easement shall be created inwriting and shall include the following:a. The legal description of the dominant and servient estates.b. A legal description of the space which must remain unobstructed expressedin termsof the degrees of the vertical and horizontal angles through which the solaraccess easementextends over the burdened property and the points from which these angles aremeasured.    Iowa code also grants municipalities the right to issue ordinances prohibitingsubdivisions from including restrictive covenants that limit the use of solarcollectors.Note: _The department of natural resources shall make available informationand guidelines to assist local government bodies and the public to understandand use the provisions. The information and guidelines shall include anapplication form for a solar access easement, instructions and aids forpreparing and recording solar access easements and model ordinances thatpromote reasonable access to solar energy._",Solar/Wind Access Policy,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA
31,Oregon,OR,BEF - Solar 4R Schools,"Bonneville Environmental Foundation's (BEF) Solar 4R Schools program began in2002. This competitive grant program seeks to install small-scale photovoltaicsystems at K-12 schools interested in increasing the visibility of renewableenergy. Successful projects will include outreach and educational componentsto encourage community adoption and use of photovoltaics.The school agrees to: own and maintain the solar system, provide access to anetwork in order to transfer solar data and offer and implement an educationaland/or public outreach strategy. Solar 4R Schools donates the photovoltaicsystem and monitoring equipment, performs all installations with help fromschool staff, and provides a renewable energy curriculum framework to theschool. Once the systems are running, the students are able to accessphotovoltaic monitoring data on school computers as they learn about renewableenergy. The data can also be displayed over the school or district website sothat the general public can see it. Solar 4R Schools has developed curriculummodules that incorporate solar and photovoltaic technology concepts to assistteachers with implementing solar energy education in the classroom.Solar 4R Schools will typically fund 50-100% of costs for approveddemonstration systems sized less than 10 kilowatts and will occasionallyconsider partially funding other larger photovoltaic projects. Solar 4RSchools usually requires a funding partner or requires matching funds from theproject applicant. Grants are awarded on a quarterly basis.

39,Oregon,OR,Net Metering,"**Eligibility and Availability**    Oregon state law requires all utilities to offer net metering pursuant toOregon Revised Statutes 757.300.* Some requirements differ between the state'sprimary investor-owned utilities (PGE and PacifiCorp) and its municipalutilities, electric cooperatives, and people's utility districts.Net-metered systems must be intended primarily to offset part or all of acustomer’s requirements for electricity. Systems that generate electricityusing solar power, wind power, hydropower, fuel cells, landfill or digestergas, biomass resources, geothermal energy, or marine energy are eligible.The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) adopted new rules for net metering forPGE and PacifiCorp customers in July 2007, raising the individual system limitfrom 25 kilowatts (kW) to two megawatts (MW) for non-residential applications.The limit on individual residential systems is 25 kW. The system size limitfor municipal utilities, electric cooperatives, and people's utility districtsis 25 kW.   **Net Excess Generation**For PGE and PacifiCorp customers, net excess generation (NEG) is carried overto the customer's next bill as a kilowatt-hour credit for a 12-month period.Unless the utility and a customer otherwise agree, the annual billing cyclewill conclude at the end of the March billing cycle of each year. Any NEGremaining at the end of a 12-month period will be credited at the utility'savoided-cost rate to customers enrolled in Oregon's low-income assistanceprograms.For customers of municipal utilities, cooperatives, and people's utilitydistricts, NEG is either purchased at the utility's avoided-cost rate orcredited to the customer's next monthly bill as a kilowatt-hour credit. At theend of an annual period, any unused NEG credit is granted to the electricutility. This credit, in turn, is then either granted to customers enrolled inthe utility's low-income assistance programs, credited to the generatingcustomer, or dedicated to ""other use."" **Aggregate Capacity Limit**  Utilities may not limit the total cumulative capacity of net metered systemsbeyond a cumulative capacity of 0.5% of the utility's historic peak load.After the cap is reached, the PUC, or the governing body if a municipalutility, electric cooperative, or people's utility district, has thediscretion to limit net metering IF deemed necessary. The PUC thus far has notimplemented the 0.5% cap for the state's two IOUs.**Equipment and Interconnection**  Net metering is achieved using a standard bi-directional meter. Utilities maynot place any additional standards or requirements on customers beyond thoserequirements established by the National Electric Code (NEC), Institute ofElectrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), and Underwriters Laboratories(UL). However, utilities may be authorized to assess a fee or charge if theutility's direct costs of interconnection and administration of net meteringoutweigh the distribution system, environmental and public-policy benefits ofallocating costs among its customers. **Meter Aggregation**For customers of PGE and PacifiCorp, the aggregation of meters for netmetering is allowed. There is no limit on the number of net-meteringfacilities per customer, as long as the capacity of all net-meteringfacilities on a customer's contiguous property does not exceed the applicablecapacity limit. Meters that are on different rate schedules are able to beaggregated. **Community Net Metering**SB 1547 of 2016 established a community solar program for Oregon. The lawrequires that utilities compensate subscribers to a community solar programfor the electricity the system produces according to the resource value ofsolar. The PUC is delegated authority to determine the resource value of solarand establish specific rules and requirements for community solar programs. **Third Party Ownership**    In July of 2008, the PUC issued a ruling to clarify that third-party investorsmay participate in net metering, and that a third-party investor’s sale ofelectricity to a utility customer does not subject the investor to regulationby the commission. **Renewable Energy Credits**Customers retain ownership of all renewable-energy credits (RECs) associatedwith the generation of electricity. _*Oregon's net metering rules do not apply to customers of Idaho Power, whichprovides net metering to Oregon customers pursuant to rules adopted by theIdaho Public Utilities Commission._",Net Metering,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA
43,Delaware,DE,Net Metering,"**Eligibility**In Delaware, net metering is available to any customer that generateselectricity using solar, wind or hydro resources, anaerobic digesters, or fuelcells capable of being powered by renewable fuels. Grid-interactive electricvehicles are also eligible for net metering treatment for electricity thatthey put on the grid, although these vehicles do not themselves generateelectricity.**System size**The maximum capacity of a net-metered system is 25 kilowatts (kW) forresidential customers; 100 kW for farm customers on residential rates; twomegawatts (MW) per meter for non-residential customers of Delmarva Power andLight (DP&L); and 500 kW per meter for non-residential customers of DelawareElectric Co-Op, Inc.(DEC) and municipal utilities. The DEC and municipalutilities are ""encouraged"" by statute to offer net metering for non-residential customers with eligible systems up to 2 MW in capacity. Systemsmust be intended primarily to offset all or part of a customer's electricityrequirements. It is important to note that while state law requires the DECand municipal utilities to offer net metering under certain terms, theadministrative rules adopted by order of the Delaware Public ServiceCommission (PSC) only apply to DP&L.Utilities are authorized to disallow additional net-metered energy systems ifthe aggregate capacity of all net-metered systems exceeds 8% (S.B. 298 of 2022increased this from 5% to 8%) of the capacity necessary to meet the electricutility's aggregated customer monthly peak demand for a particular calendaryear.    **Net-excess generation:**Customers are generally credited in kilowatt-hours (kWh), valued at an amountper kWh equal to the sum of delivery service charges and supply servicecharges for residential customers, and equal to the sum of the volumetricenergy (kWh) components of the delivery service charges and supply servicecharges for non-residential customers, for any net excess generation (NEG) ina billing period. NEG is carried over to subsequent billing periods to offseta customer's consumption in those billing periods until all credits are usedor at least until the end of a 12-month annual period. In essence, NEG iscarried over to the customer's next bill at the utility's retail rate. Thedefault annual period begins during the month in which the system isinterconnected, but the customer is permitted to change the period once inorder to better utilize excess generation. An exception to retail creditingexists for certain community-owned systems (i.e., those with multiplesubscribers). Subscribers to the output of a community-owned system that islocated behind a customer meter or as a stand-alone facility only receiveretail credit if they are located on the same distribution feeder as thefacility. Those that are not on the same distribution feeder only receivecredit at the wholesale energy supply rate.    Customers may request a payment for unused NEG at the end of the annualizedperiod at the supply service rate, but it does not appear that they arerequired to do so, meaning that NEG can be rolled over indefinitely at thechoice of the customer. Should the customer request a payment for annual NEG,the supplier is permitted to submit the payment as a bill credit if it is lessthan $25.00. Customers retain ownership of renewable-energy credits (RECs)associated with electricity produced and consumed by the customer.**Meter aggregation:**Delaware expanded the state's net-metering policy with S.B. 267 to allowcustomers to aggregate individual meters, to participate in net-metering via asubscribers ""sharing a unique set of interests"" to community-owned system orand aggregation of a customer's multiple accounts, to allow net-meteringsystems to provide up to 110% of a customers' expected aggregate electricityconsumption, extending net-metering to leased and third party owned systems,and for single or aggregation of a customer's multiple accounts, and extendingnet-metering to fuel cells as well as renewable energy fuel cells forcommunity-owned systems.    **History** :  Net metering was expanded significantly in July 2007 by S.B. 8, which extendednet metering to all customer classes, added biogas and fuel cells as eligibletechnologies, addressed the ownership of RECs, and increased the priorindividual system limit of 25 kW, among other changes. The law wassignificantly amended by S.B. 85 in 2009 to extend net metering to farmservice customers on residential rates; remove provisions requiring annualforfeiture of net excess generation (NEG); revise language relating toownership of renewable energy credits produced by net metered systems; and, toexpand the aggregate program capacity limit from 1% of Electric Supplier'saggregated customer monthly peak demand to 5% of Electric Supplier'saggregated customer monthly peak demand. Separately, S.B. 153 enacted inSeptember 2009 extends net metering to the owner of a grid-integrated electricvehicle.

Effective January 1, 2021, systems must be sized to provide nomore than 140% of the customer's historical 12-month usage. This limit willincrease by 20 percentage points annually until 2024 when systems can be sizedto provide no more than 200% of the customer's historical 12-month usage. Theterm ""renewable energy sources"" is defined as solar, wind, tidal, geothermal,biomass, hydroelectric facilities, and digester gas.  **Net Excess Generation:**The District's net-metering rules specify that metering equipment must becapable of measuring the flow of electricity in two directions. Utilities arenot prohibited from installing an additional meter on the facilities ofeligible customer-generators, but utilities that choose to do so must pay forthe added cost of the second meter and/or other necessary equipment. Forsystems 100 kW or smaller, NEG is credited to the customer's next bill at thefull retail rate, which includes generation, transmission, and distributioncomponents.

108,District of Columbia,DC,Sustainable Energy Trust Fund,"The District of Columbia's Retail Electric Competition and Consumer ProtectionAct of 1999 required the DC Public Service Commission (PSC) to establish apublic benefits fund to provide energy assistance to low-income residents, andto support energy-efficiency programs and renewable-energy programs. Thisfund, known as the Reliable Energy Trust Fund (RETF), took effect in 2001. InOctober 2008, the District of Columbia enacted the Clean and Affordable EnergyAct (CAEA), which effectively eliminated the RETF and replaced it with theSustainable Energy Trust Fund (SETF). This program is administered by thethird-party DC Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) which develops, coordinates,and provides programs for promoting the sustainable use of energy in theDistrict of Columbia. Since 2011, DCSEU has saved residents $1.2 billion inenergy, invested over fifty million in low-income communities, and prevented6.2 million tons of greenhouse gases. For more information on the DCSEU'ssuccess visit here. **Funding**  The SETF is financed by a non-bypassable surcharge on the electric and naturalgas bills of utility customers who are not Residential Aid Discount (RAD) orResidential Essential Service (RES) customers. The surcharge for natural gascustomers is calculated on a per term basis and is assessed at $0.011 inFiscal Year (FY) 2009, $0.012 in FY 2010, and $0.014 in FY 2012 and eachsubsequent year. The surcharge for electric customers is calculated on a per-kilowatt-hour basis and is assessed at $0.0011 in FY 2009, $0.0013 in FY 2010and $0.0015 in FY 2011 and each subsequent year. The October 2008 legislationalso established a separate Energy Assistance Trust Fund (EATF). The EATFcollects a surcharge of $0.006/term from natural gas sales. It collects$0.0000607/kWh from electric sales in general, plus an additional assessment$0.00069/kWh for June - September 2010. Electricity collections were formerlyset at $0.0004/kWh, but the law regarding the EATF surcharge was amended in2010.The 2020 annual budget amounted to just under twenty million dollars, anyunused funding will carry over to the following year. Notable expendituresinclude $2.4M to low-income multifamily projects, $814,000 in energy rebatesto businesses, $1.1M to workforce development, and $4.4M to custom commercialrenovations and installations.**Programs**  In the past, the RETF program supported weatherization measures; appliancereplacements for low-income residents; RAD extension; LIHEAP expansion andeducation; energy efficiency for small businesses, institutions and nonprofits; ENERGY STAR appliance and lighting rebates, home energy ratings andloan promotions, public education and outreach, distributed generation and netmetering; and renewable-energy demonstration projects.

157,Connecticut,CT,Connecticut Clean Energy Fund,"Connecticut’s 1998 electric restructuring legislation established theRenewable Energy Investment Fund.* The Renewable Energy Investment Fund waslater renamed the Clean Energy Fund, which the Clean Energy Finance andInvestment Authority (CEFIA)** -- a quasi-governmental investment organization-- was given the authority to administer. In operation since 2000, the CleanEnergy Fund has aimed to develop, invest in, and promote, sustainable energysources. A surcharge on Connecticut ratepayers' utility bills provides thefunding for the Clean Energy Fund, and the charge currently stands at ""notless than"" $0.001 per kWh (1 mill per kWh).CEFIA was given a significant amount of flexibility by the Connecticut GeneralAssembly to develop programs and fund projects that aligned with the CleanEnergy Fund’s mission. CEFIA has since been renamed as the Connecticut GreenBank. Connecticut General Statute § 16-245n stipulates that the ConnecticutGreen Bank shall: (A) develop separate programs to finance and otherwisesupport clean energy investment in residential, municipal, small business andlarger commercial projects and such others as it may determine; (B) supportfinancing or other expenditures that promote investment in clean energysources in accordance with a comprehensive plan developed by it to foster thegrowth, development and commercialization of clean energy sources and relatedenterprises; and (C) stimulate demand for clean energy and the deployment ofclean energy sources with the state that serve end-use customers in the state.The Connecticut Green Bank receives guidance from a board of directors, whosemembers include the Commissioners of the Department of Economic and CommunityDevelopment and the Department of Energy & Environmental Protection;additional members are appointed by the Connecticut General Assembly and theConnecticut governor. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection isrequired to approve a comprehensive plan for the Clean Energy Fund and reviewits annual reports. Furthermore, the fund is audited annually.The Connecticut Green Bank leverages rate payer funds to raise privateinvestment and further support renewable and clean energy development in thestate. According to Connecticut General Statute § 16-245n, the ConnecticutGreen Bank is authorized to invest in “solar photovoltaic energy, solarthermal, geothermal energy, wind, ocean thermal energy, wave or tidal energy,fuel cells, landfill gas, hydropower that meets the low-impact standards ofthe Low-Impact Hydropower Institute, hydrogen production and hydrogenconversion technologies, low emission advanced biomass conversiontechnologies, alternative fuels, used for electricity generation includingethanol, biodiesel or other fuel produced in Connecticut and derived fromagricultural produce, food waste or waste vegetable oil, provided theCommissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection determines that such fuelsprovide net reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuelconsumption, usable electricity from combined heat and power systems withwaste heat recovery systems, thermal storage systems, other energy resourcesand emerging technologies which have significant potential forcommercialization and which do not involve the combustion of coal, petroleumor petroleum products, municipal solid waste or nuclear fission, financing ofenergy efficiency projects, projects that seek to deploy electric, electrichybrid, natural gas or alternative fuel vehicles and associatedinfrastructure, any related storage, distribution, manufacturing technologiesor facilities and any Class I renewable energy source.”Further developments in the law required the Connecticut Green Bank toestablish particular clean energy programs. For example, the Connecticut GreenBank created both a combined heat and power and residential rooftop solarprogram and the Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) program.Furthermore, recently-enacted laws have supported the notion that theConnecticut Green Bank is integral to the state’s plan of expanding greenenergy. More energy improvements are now eligible for participation in theC-PACE program, and the Connecticut Green Bank was given ownership of SolarHome Renewable Energy Credits (“SHRECs”), which are generated from qualifyingresidential PV systems. Investor-owned electric distribution companies arerequired to purchase SHRECs in long-term contracts, and municipalities mustincorporate residential PV systems into their building permit applicationprocesses. Additionally, the Connecticut Green Bank has been granted manybusiness-related powers so that it has more flexibility in achieving its goalof continued renewable energy growth. The Connecticut Green Bank has evolvedinto an agency that has direct statutory authority for its operations.For more details on existing programs -- including funding amounts per program-- see the most recent annual report and the individual program records onDSIRE.For more information read the GT Green Bank Comprehensive Plans._* Connecticut's restructuring legislation also created a systems benefitscharge to fund public education, weatherization and energy conservationmeasures for low-income residents, storage and disposal costs for spentnuclear fuel, and post-retirement costs for decommissioned nuclear reactors.__** Legislation passed in July 2011 completely restructured the Clean EnergyFund and created the Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority.

167,Oregon,OR,Business Energy Tax Credit,"** _NOTE: In June 2011, the Oregon State Legislature passedHB3672, makingsignificant changes to the Business Energy Tax Credit program.  This programwill be redesigned, though details on the new program are not available yet.This record is for informational purposes only._**    Oregon's Business Energy Tax Credit (BETC) is for investments in energyconservation, recycling, renewable energy resources, sustainable buildings,and less-polluting transportation fuels. Any Oregon business may qualify,including, but not limited to, manufacturing plants, stores, offices,apartment buildings, farms, and transportation. The tax credit can cover costsdirectly related to the project, including equipment cost, engineering anddesign fees, materials, supplies and installation costs. Loan fees and permitcosts also may be claimed. However, replacing equipment at the end of itsuseful life or equipment required to meet codes or other governmentregulations are not eligible. Maintenance costs are also not eligible. Allprojects must meet the applicable BETC technical requirements to qualify.    Projects that use solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass or fuel cells(renewable fuels only) to produce energy, displace energy, or reclaim energyfrom waste may qualify for a tax credit. Renewable resource projects mustreplace at least 10% of the electricity, gas or oil used. The energy can beused on site or sold. Solar arrays that take BETC must be used solely forbusiness purposes, unless being installed by a homebuilder or on a rentaldwelling or high performance home. Solar systems that are taking advantage ofOregon's Pilot Solar Volumetric Incentive Rates and Payments Program are noteligible for BETC. The tax credit for facilities using or producing renewableenergy resources is capped at $300 million for systems pre-certified from July1, 2009 to June 30, 2011 and $150 million for systems pre-certified betweenJuly 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012. Projects must receive final certificationbefore July 1, 2012, to use the tax credit. Renewable energy equipmentmanufacturing facilities must receive preliminary certification before January1, 2014, in order to use the tax credit.    The tax credit is also available to homebuilders who install renewable energysystems on the homes they construct. The maximum tax credit for a homebuilderis $9,000 per single-family home, or $12,000 if the system is installed on acertified high-performance home. To be considered a high-performance home, thedwelling must be certified through the Northwest Energy Star Homes Program,and meet additional requirements outlined in the technical requirements.    General retrofit projects, in addition to those for lighting, andweatherization projects for rental property may be eligible for the program,as well as new construction projects, including energy efficiency andlighting. Retrofit projects must be 10% more energy efficient than theexisting installation; lighting retrofits must be 25% more efficient thanexisting lighting. For new buildings, all measures must reduce energy use byat least 10% compared to a similar building that meets the minimumrequirements of the state energy code.    Cogeneration projects may also be eligible. Projects that develop new marketsfor recycled materials or recycle materials not required by law may beeligible for the tax credit. Projects that reduce employee commuting (or work-related travel) and investments in cleaner-burning fuels may qualify.    Different cost caps and percentage caps apply to different technologies.Generally, the maximum allowable credits are as follows:  * Renewable energy equipment manufacturing: 50% of certified project costs, distributed over five years (10% per year), up to $20 million;  * Renewable energy generation, high efficiency combined heat and power: 50% of certified project costs, distributed over five years (10% per year), up to $10 million;  * Wind projects over 10 MW: 50% of certified project costs (though only 5% of total project costs are certified costs), up to $2.5 million*;  * All other projects: 35% of certified project costs, distributed over five years (10% in the first and second years, 5% each year thereafter), up to $3.5 million; and  * Credit to homebuilder: $9,000 per single-family home, or $12,000 if the system is installed on a certified high-performance home.Under the pass-through option, a project owner may transfer a tax credit to apass-through partner in return for a lump-sum cash payment (the net presentvalue of the tax credit) upon completion of the project. The pass-throughoption allows non-profit organizations, schools, governmental agencies,tribes, and other public entities and businesses without tax liability to usethe Business Energy Tax Credit by transferring their tax credit for aneligible project to a partner with a tax liability. As of January 1, 2010, thepass-through rate ""is determined by taking the total tax credit amount dividedby the sum of one plus three times the five year United States Treasury Noteminus the average of the net change for the three previous calendar years ofthe urban Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the west region based on the indexpublished on the first day of the calendar quarter and the first day of thesame calendar quarter for the previous three calendar years exponentiallyraised by 5.""    Applications and instructions are available on the program web site. The ODOEhas published a brochure to explain how the tax credit works.    **History:**  Since the Business Energy Tax Credit was originally created, several pieces oflegislation have modified the credit and these caps. In 2001, the OregonLegislature added sustainable buildings to the list of measures and systemseligible for the tax credit. This addition became effective October 8, 2001,and is retroactive to January 1, 2001. In addition to several requirements setforth by the ODOE, the building must meet established standards set by theU.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design(LEED) for Silver Certification.    HB 3201, enacted in July 2007, increased the tax credit to 50% of the totalcost for renewable energy, high efficiency combined heat and power, andrenewable energy equipment manufacturing facilities, with a maximum credit of$10 million. The tax credit for all other projects remains at 35% of eligibleproject costs. The 50% tax credit is taken over five years -- 10% each year.Any unused credit may be carried forward up to eight years. Those witheligible project costs of $20,000 or less may take the tax credit in one year.These changes were retroactive to include projects beginning on or afterJanuary 1, 2007. This legislation also created a sunset date of January 1,2016, though this sunset date has since been modified.    In March 2008, HB 3619 increased the maximum credit just for manufacturers ofrenewable energy equipment to $20 million (50% of a $40 million facility). HB3619 also requires the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) to set standardsrelated to what constitutes a manufacturing facility, as well as thefacility's minimum level of increased employment, financial viability, and theinfluence that the BETC would have on a manufacturer locating in Oregon. ODOEcan apply those standards to certify a lesser amount of costs than appliedfor, including zero costs. HB 3619 also requires ODOE to consider criteriarelating to the state's general fund before determining the amount of costseligible for the BETC.    In November 2009, the Oregon Department of Energy adopted temporaryadministrative rules (effective from November 3, 2009, to May 1, 2010) thatmore stringently define criteria for separate and distinct facilities for thepurpose of applying for multiple credits. The new rules also allow the OregonDepartment of Energy to revoke certificates and recapture the tax credit if aproject does not produce the amount of energy, jobs, or conservation describedin the application. Any projects that were not pre-certified by November 3,2009, were subject to the new rules.    In March 2010, HB 3680 was signed by the governor, reducing the maximum creditavailable to wind facilities that have an installed capacity of more than 10MW. These facilities are eligible for a tax credit of 50% of certified costs(though only 5% of total costs may be included in certification costs), up to$3.5 million for projects pre-certified between January 1, 2010 and December31, 2010. Systems pre-certified between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011,are eligible for a tax credit up to $2.5 million. Systems pre-certified on orafter January 1, 2012, are eligible for a tax credit up to $1.5 million. Thisbill also created a maximum cap on the number of tax credits awarded. The taxcredit for facilities using or producing renewable energy resources is cappedat $300 million for systems pre-certified from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2011,and $150 million for systems pre-certified between July 1, 2011 and June 30,2012. Finally, this bill increased the discretion the Oregon Department ofEnergy has in issuing tax credits. The changes made by this bill wereincorporated into the temporary administrative rules issued May 21, 2010. Thetemporary rules were effective until permanent rules replaced them on November23, 2010. These new rules are in effect for all preliminary and finalapplications received on or after July 1, 2009.      _* These facilities are eligible for a tax credit of 50% of certified costs,up to $3.5 million for projects pre-certified between January 1, 2010, andDecember 31, 2010. Systems pre-certified between January 1, 2011 and December31, 2011, are eligible for a tax credit up to $2.5 million.

A facilitythat is owned, operated, leased or controlled by a governmental entity is alsoineligible for this abatement.    _**History**_  This abatement has gone through revisions since its original inception. Mostsignificantly, AB 522, signed in May 2009, raised the capacity minimum foreligible projects from 10 kilowatts (kW) to 10 MW. It also increased theabatement from 50% for 10 years to 55% for 20 years, extended it to additionaltechnologies, and increased the qualification requirements to ensure thatincentivized projects result in more high quality jobs. These changes tookeffect on July 1, 2009. AB 522 also created a sales and use tax abatement forrenewable energy producers.    * _Biomass is defined as any organic matter that is available on a renewable basis, including, without limitation, agricultural crops and agricultural wastes and residues; wood and wood wastes and residues; animal wastes; municipal wastes; and aquatic plants._",Property Tax Incentive,Financial Incentive,1,http://energy.nv.gov/Programs/Renewable_Energy_Tax_Abatements/,7/1/2009,2009

195,Connecticut,CT,Renewables Portfolio Standard,"Established in 1998 and subsequently revised several times, Connecticut'srenewables portfolio standard (RPS) requires each electric supplier and eachelectric distribution company wholesale supplier to obtain at least 24% of itsretail load by using renewable energy by January 1, 2020. The RPS alsorequires each electric supplier and each electric distribution companywholesale supplier to obtain at least 4% of its retail load by using combinedheat and power (CHP) systems and energy efficiency by 2010. In 2018, PublicAct No. 18-50, according to Substitute Senate Bill 9, extended the renewableportfolio standard to year 2030, demanding at least 40% Class I renewableenergy resources and 4% Class I or II renewable energy resources by January 1,2030. Public Act No. 18-50 also increased the 2020 target from 20% to 21%,with the exception of utilities under certain conditions.**Eligible Technologies:**Separate portfolio standards are required for energy resources classified as""Class I,"" ""Class II,"" or ""Class III."" Class I resources include electricityderived from solar power, wind power, fuel cells, geothermal, landfill methanegas, anaerobic digestion or other biogas derived from biological sources,thermal electric direct energy conversion, ocean thermal power, wave or tidalpower, low-emission advanced renewable energy conversion technologies, run-of-the-river hydropower facilities not exceeding 30 megawatts (MW) in capacity,and biomass facilities that use sustainable biomass fuel and meet certainemissions requirements. In 2018, Substitute Senate Bill 9 defined low emissionadvanced renewable energy conversion technologies as including, but notlimited to, zero emission low grade heat power generation systems based onorganic oil free rankine, kalina or other similar nonsteam cycles that usewaste heat from an industrial or commercial process that does not generateelectricity. Substitute Senate Bill 9 also made run-of-the-river hydropowerfacilities that received a new license after January 1, 2018 an eligible ClassI energy source.Class II resources include trash-to-energy facilities that have obtainedrequired permits.    Class III resources include: (1) customer-sided CHP systems, with a minimumoperating efficiency of 50%, installed at commercial or industrial facilitiesin Connecticut on or after January 1, 2006; (2) electricity savings fromconservation and load management programs that started on or after January 1,2006, and (3) systems that recover waste heat or pressure from commercial andindustrial processes installed on or after April 1, 2007.**Requirements and Carve-outs:**    Electric providers must meet the standard with at least 40% Class I resourcesand 4% Class I or II resources by January 1, 2030, and 4% Class III sources by2010, and thereafter, according to the following schedule:  * **On and after 1/1/2006:** 2.0% Class I + 3% Class I or II  * **On and after 1/1/2007:** 3.5% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 1% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2008:** 5.0% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 2% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2009:** 6.0% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 3% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2010:** 7.0% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2011:** 8.0% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2012:** 9.0% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2013:** 10.0% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2014:** 11.0% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2015:** 12.5% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2016:** 14.0% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2017:** 15.5% Class I + 3% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2018:** 17.0% Class I + 4% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2019:** 19.5% Class I + 4% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * **On and after 1/1/2020:** 21.0% Class I + 4% Class I or II + 4% Class III  *  **On and after 1/1/2021** : 22.5% Class I + 4% Class I or II + 4% Class III  *  **On and after 1/1/2022** : 24% Class I + 4% Class I or II + 5% Class III  *  **On and after 1/1/2023** : 26% Class I + 4% Class I or II + 5% Class III  *  **On and after 1/1/2024** : 28% Class I + 4% Class I or II + 5% Class III  *  **On and after 1/1/2025** : 30% Class I + 4% Class I or II + 4% Class III  * ...  *  **On and after 1/1/2030** : 40% Class I + 4% Class I or II + 4% Class III*From 2025 to 2030, the Class I requirement increases by 2% annually, with 4% Class I or II and 4% Class III requirement keeping the same. RPS requirements may be satisfied by purchasing electricity generated usingClass I or Class II resources within the jurisdiction of the regionalindependent system operator (ISO New England). However starting January 2014,the Public Act 13-303 prohibits any renewable energy credits that are alreadyclaimed or counted by another State towards meeting their own renewableportfolio standards or goals to be eligible for compliance towards CT’s RPSrequirement. This measure was to put in place to stop double counting of RECs,where RECs produced by an out of state facility were being used to meet RPSrequirement in two different States.Renewable energy credit trades and purchases are tracked through the NewEngland Power Pool Generation Information System (NEPOOL GIS). Connecticutrenewable energy sources can be located in the Independent System Operator ofNew England (ISO-NE) Control Area or the Adjacent Control Area. The ISO-NEControl Area includes: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, RhodeIsland and Vermont. The Adjacent Control Area that can import into ISO-NEincludes: New York, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces (New Brunswick, NovaScotia and Prince Edward Island).Beginning in 2015, REC values for Class I biomass and landfill methane gas(not including anaerobic digestion and other biogas facilities) will graduallydecrease per a schedule established by the Department of Energy andEnvironmental Protection (DEEP). Any facility that has entered into a powerpurchase agreement before June 5, 2013 will not be effected by the decreasingREC values.Public Act 11-80 of 2011 requires the Connecticut Green Bank (formerly knownas the Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority) to develop a residentialsolar incentive program that will result in a minimum 30 megawatts of newresidential solar by December 31, 2022, and will be funded by the state'sexisting public benefits fund. Energy produced from systems funded in this wayhelp reduce utility RPS obligations.Public Act 13-303 also allows the DEEP commissioner to issue RFPs and requireelectric companies to enter into contracts with renewable energy systemowners. All RECs will be sold in the regional REC market to be used bysuppliers or electric companies to meet RPS obligations. RFPs may be issuedfor (1) Class I resources built on or after January 1, 2013 (limited to 4% ofpower distributed by electric companies); (2) Class I resources built beforeJanuary 1, 2013 and hydropower over 30 MW built on or after January 1, 2003 inthe New England REC market area (limited to 5% of the load distributed byelectric companies); (3) Class I hydropower, landfill methane gas, and biomass(limited to 4% of the load distributed by electric companies).   **Offshore Wind Target**H.B. 7156 of 2019 requires the Department of Energy and EnvironmentalProtection (DEEP) to solicit up to 2 GW of offshore wind capacity. In December2019, DEEP announced its selection for the procurement of 804 MW of offshorewind power from Park City Wind Project.  **Compliance:**Electric providers that fail to comply with the RPS during an annual periodmust pay $0.055 per kWh ($55/MWh) to the PURA. Unlike most other states thathave an increasing compliance payment systems, CT has a fixed compliancepayment. As compliance payment, theoretically represent the maximum price theREC can achieve, the price of RECs in CT are traded below $55. Startingcalendar year 2018 and up to and including calendar year 2020, the compliancepayment is set to $0.055 per kWh if the wholesale supplier fails to comply forClass I renewable energy resource, and $0.025 per kWh if the wholesalesupplier fails to comply with Class II standard. Starting from calendar year2021, the compliance payment rate is set to $0.04 per kWh for Class I and$0.025 per kWh for Class II.CT offers a 5th year compliance, where a Load Serving Entity (LSE) canpurchase RECs in January through March of the following year to use them forprior year compliance. The RECs can be banked for 2 years and is limited to30% of the load.Compliance payments were historically used for the Connecticut Clean EnergyFund (CCEF) for the development of Class I renewables. However, beginning in2013, those payments will be used to refund ratepayers to offset the cost ofLREC and ZREC contracts (see below) and other costs passed through toratepayers. The PURA Renewable Energy web site provides additional documentsrelated to its RPS.**Long-term contracts for LRECs and ZRECs:**Public Act 11-80 of 2011 also requires that utilities enter into long-termcontracts (15 years) for renewable energy credits from zero emission Class Irenewable energy facilities (on the customer side of the meter) up to 1 MW.Zero emission Class I facilities include solar, wind, and hydro generators.Resulting zero emission renewable energy credits (ZRECs) may be used for RPScompliance during the year of generation or the subsequent year. Utilities arerequired to spend $8 million on contracts in year one, $16 million in yeartwo, $24 million in year three, and $32 million in year four -- at which pointthe PURA will conduct a review. The maximum payment per ZREC authorized duringthe first year is $350. PURA may reduce this maximum per ZREC price yearly by3-7%. The electric distribution companies submitted their six-yearsolicitation plan to PURA in December 2011. A Request for Proposal will beissued in the first half of 2012. See PURA docket 11-12-06 for additionaldetails.Public Act 11-80 of 2011 also requires that utilities enter into long-termcontracts (15 years) for renewable energy credits from low emission Class Irenewable energy facilities (on the customer side of the meter) up to 2 MW.The law establishes the emission criteria required to achieve ""low emissionfacility"" status, but **_could_** include facilities that generate using fuelcells, biomass, and landfill gas. Resulting low emission renewable energycredits (LRECs) may be used for RPS compliance during the year of generationor the subsequent year. Utilities are required to spend up to $4 million oncontracts in year one, and an additional $4 million in subsequent years. PURAwill conduct a review in year three. The maximum payment per LREC authorizedduring year one is $200. As part of the six-year solicitation plan for ZRECs,the utilities companies also included their solicitation plan for LRECs. TheRFP for ZRECs will also solicit LRECs. **Solar Home Renewable Energy Credits (SHRECs)**HB 6838 enacted on June 2015 expanded the Green Bank’s Residential SolarInvestment program to support up to 300 MW of new solar PV by 2022. Asignificant portion of the funding for the expansion of the program will bederived through the sale of Solar Home Renewable Energy Credits (SHRECs).SHRECs represent the environmental attributes of one megawatt hour ofelectricity generated through residential solar PV systems that are installedthrough CT Green Bank on or after January 1st, 2015. These SHRECs are similarto the Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) that are popular in other Statesthat include a solar carve-out in their RPS. CT RPS does not include a solarcarve-out, however it has created SHRECs to facilitate the growth of itsresidential solar by requiring the electric distribution companies to sell aportion of electric load through SHRECs.Any SHRECs created by the residential solar system that participate in theResidential Solar Investment program will automatically be transferred to theGreen Bank. These SHRECs will have a term life of 2years, including its yearof production and the following year. The Green Bank will sell the SHRECs tothe electric distribution companies (EDCs) through a master purchase agreementwith a term of 15 years. EDCs will be required to purchase SHRECs based ontheir respective distribution system loads. The price of the SHRECs will bedetermined by the Green Bank, which shall not exceed the price of small ZRECs,or will be set five dollars less than the State’s Alternative CompliancePayment (ACP). The EDCs may retire the SHRECs for their compliance with theClass I portion of their Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirement, orresell the credits. All the proceeds from the resale of SHRECs will becredited to the EDCs customers. Systems that participate in the state’s ZRECprogram cannot participate in the SHREC program.  * _Previously known as the Connecticut Department of Public Utilities (DPUC)._",Renewables Portfolio Standard,Regulatory Policy,1,http://www.ct.gov/pura/cwp/view.asp?a=3354&q=415186,NA,2006

246,Oregon,OR,Energy Trust of Oregon,"Oregon's 1999 electric-utility restructuring legislation (SB 1149) requiredPacific Power and Portland General Electric (PGE) to collect a 3% public-purpose charge from their customers to support renewable energy and energyefficiency projects through January 1, 2012. Of the funds collected by theelectric utilities, 56.7% must be allocated towards energy efficiency programsand 17.1% to renewables. The remaining funds support low-income housing energyassistance and K-12 school energy-conservation efforts. The Oregon PublicUtility Commission (OPUC) authorized the Energy Trust of Oregon, anindependent non-profit organization, to administer these programs beginning in2002.    Oregon’s renewable portfolio standard legislation (SB 838), enacted in June2007, established a goal that by 2025 at least 8% of Oregon's retailelectrical load comes from small-scale renewable energy projects with acapacity of 20 megawatts (MW) or less. To support this goal, the legislationmodified the public purpose charge for renewables to require that funding beused to support only smaller projects of 20 MW or less. The sunset date on theoriginal 10-year public purpose charge was extended through 2025. Lastly, thelegislation allowed for the electric utilities to fund additional, cost-effective electric efficiency above what could be obtained through the 3%charge.    In addition to its work under the 1999 energy restructuring law, the EnergyTrust administers gas conservation programs for residential and commercialcustomers of NW Natural (starting in 2003 for Oregon customers and 2009 forWashington State customers), Cascade Natural Gas Corporation (starting July2006), and Avista (starting in January 2017).    The Energy Trust's renewable energy programs include financial incentives forsmall- and mid-scale projects that generate energy from solar, wind, hydro,bio power, and geothermal resources. Efficiency programs include incentivesfor improvements to residential (new, existing, and manufactured homes),commercial, multifamily, and new buildings; retrofits; appliances; andmanufacturing and agricultural processes. The Energy Trust acceptsapplications for funding in response to specific programs, as well as throughan open solicitation process. At least 80% of the energy conservationexpenditures are required to be concentrated in the service territory of theutility where the funds were collected.",Public Benefits Fund,Regulatory Policy,1,http://www.energytrust.org/about/,NA,NA

270,Nevada,NV,Nevada Solar and Wind Easement Laws,"Nevada has a number of laws which prohibit restrictions on solar and windenergy systems.Nevada Revised Statutes 111.239 and 111.2395 relate to property. The lawsdisallow covenants, deeds, contracts, ordinances or other legal instrumentswhich unreasonably restrict a property owner from using a solar or wind energysystem on his or her property. For solar systems, unreasonable restrictionsare those which decrease system performance by more than 10%. For windsystems, unreasonable restrictions are those which “significantly” decreasethe efficiency or performance of the system. Further restrictions can beplaced on a wind system based on its height, noise or safety.Nevada Revised Statutes 278.02077 and 278.0208 relate to zoning. The lawsprevent governing bodies from adopting ordinances or regulations whichprohibit or unreasonably restrict property owners from obtaining wind or solarenergy on their property. The statute related to wind was amended in 2017 toprovide that the governing body of a city or county may deny an installationpermit for obtaining wind energy if the size, height or configuration of thesystem: (1) represents a danger to the health, safety or welfare of thepublic; or (2) is not compatible with the character of the area in which thesystem is located.NRS 116.2111 ensures that common-interest communities may not unreasonablyrestrict or withhold approval for a unit’s owner to add a wind energy systemto the unit, so long as the boundaries of the unit encompass 2 acres or moreof the common-interest community. The unit owner must first obtain the writtenconsent of each owner of property within 300 feet of any boundary of the unit.Nevada law also allows parties to enter voluntarily into solar easements thatare legally binding.",Solar/Wind Access Policy,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA
277,Connecticut,CT,Residential Renewable Energy Solutions,"**_NOTE: In May 2018,S.B. 9 signed into law and made significant changes tothe state's Renewable Portfolio Standard and Net Metering policies. The lawends net metering to new customers when the Residential Solar InvestmentProgram ends on January 1, 2022. The existing net metering customers will begrandfathered until December 2039. Starting January 1, 2022, new customerswill be able to select a buy-all, sell-all option, or net billing option underthe new Net-Tariff program. The Public Utilities Regulator Authority (PURA)has finished implementing the new program as the Residential Renewable EnergySolutions Program. Non-residential customers can participate in the Non-Residential Renewable Energy Solutions Program.  _**Connecticut’s two investor-owned utilities, Eversource and UnitedIlluminating, are required to offer two kinds of tariffs to new customers whoown Class I renewable energy resources, which include solar, wind, landfillgas, fuel cells, sustainable biomass, ocean-thermal power, wave or tidalpower, low-emission advanced renewable-energy conversion technologies, andhydropower facilities up to two megawatts (MW) in capacity. __ Beginning in2023, energy storage paired with solar is also eligible, but only for the Buy-All tariff.  There is no stated limit on the aggregate capacity of net-metered systems in autility's service territory. Any net excess generation (NEG) during a monthlybilling period is carried over to the following month as a kilowatt-hour (kWh)credit for one year. At the end of the year (March 31), the utility pays thecustomer for any remaining NEG at the avoided cost of wholesale power.Residential Renewable Energy Solutions offers new residential installationsinstalled after January 1st, 2022 the opportunity to sell the energy andrenewable energy certificates (RECs) at a fixed 20-year price by selecting oneof two incentive rate structures: 1) Buy-all or 2) Netting. Under the Buy-Allincentive rate structure, the utility will purchase all energy and RECsgenerated by the facility. Under the Netting incentive rate structure, theutility will purchase all RECs generated by the facility, and any energyexported to the grid that is not consumed on-site. Customers receive monetaryon-bill credits for the exported energy equal to their retail rate. Customerswho installed solar before December 31st, 2021 will maintain their netmetering contract until 2039.  Customers are locked into their rate for 20 years. The Buy-All and Nettingrates are reviewed for changes annually, but these changes only affect newcustomers; a customer will keep the rate of their entry year for the entiretyof the 20-year contract. New customers can enroll through 2027. Residentialcustomers that choose the Netting option must also pay a non-bypassable chargebeginning in 2024. The following incentive rates will be in effect foreligible applications received in 2023:  **** | **Buy-All Rate $/kWh** | **** | **Netting Rates $/kWh**  ---|---|---|---  |  |  | _**Incentive Rate**  _ | _**REC Rate**_  **Eversource** | $0.2943 |  | Retail Rate  | $0.0318  **United Illuminating** | $0.2943 |  | Retail Rate  | $0.0000  **Low-Income Adder** | $0.030  |  |  | $0.025  **Distressed Municipality Adder** | $0.0175  |  |  | $0.0125      Qualified facilities serving customers with incomes 60% or below the StateMedian Income are eligible to receive the Low-Income Adder.

287,Rhode Island,RI,Net Metering,"**_NOTE: In January 2018, National Grid filed approval of its revised netmetering tariff to include the changed adopted by RI legislation to expandcommunity solar (remote net metering) to include educational institutions,hospitals, and non-profit corporations. It also removes the 30 MW cap onmaximum aggregate amount of remote net metering for public entity facilities,multi-municipal collaboratives, educational institutions, federal government,hospitals or nonprofits._**Rhode Island allows net metering for systems up to ten megawatts (MW) incapacity that are designed to generate up to 125% of the electricity that ahome or other facility uses. Net metering is available to residential A-16(standard residential) and A-60 (income-eligible residential) rate codecustomers. The net metered systems size must be sized to produce no more thanan average of previous or forecasted three years of annual consumption of theenergy at the account. Systems that generate electricity using solar energy,wind energy, ocean-thermal energy, geothermal energy, small hydropower, biogasfrom anaerobic digestion, or fuel cells using any of these energy sources areeligible. All customers of electric distribution companies including publicentities of the state are eligible. The aggregate amount of net-meteredsystems in Block Island Power Company is capped at 10% of the peak load and inPascoag Utility District is capped at 3% of the peak load, as determined bythe Public Utilities Commission.* In 2014, the aggregate cap for net meteringfor National Grid was eliminated. Net metered systems may be owned by thecustomer or be financed by a third party through a lease or power/creditpurchase agreements. A third party engaged in financing net metered systems isnot considered a public utility.**Net Excess Generation:**The rate credited for kilowatt-hours (kWh) generated that do not exceed thecustomer's kWh consumption for that billing period is equal to the utility'sretail rate (minus a very small conservation charge per kWh). Any excess kWhgeneration that exceeds 100% but limited up to 125% of the net-meteringcustomer's usage during the billing period will be paid excess renewable net-metering credits which is equal to the utilities avoided cost rate, which iscalculated as electric distribution company's standard offer service kWhcharge for the rate class and Time of Use billing period, if applicable. Theexcess credit may be carried forward to the next bill or purchased by theutility (at its discretion). To facilitate the administration of billing,utilities may estimate a net-metered customer's generation and consumptionover a 12-month period. Otherwise, the rates (including customer charges anddemand charges) that apply to a net-metered customer must be the same ratesthat would apply if the same customer were not net metering. Utilities may notimpose any other charges on the net-metered customers. Net-metered customersare exempt from backup or standby rates commensurate with the size of the net-metered system. Utilities may recover the costs of program administrationthrough rates. **Meter Aggregation:**A system generally must be owned by the customer of record and sited on thecustomer's premises (in the same geographic location). However, facilities (1)owned by public entity** or multi-municipal collaborative or (2) owned andoperated by a developer on behalf of the public entity or multi-municipalcollaborative through “public entity net metering financing arrangement”***are eligible for _virtual net metering_. Eligible entities include stateagencies, quasi-state agencies, municipalities, public housing authorities,public schools, private schools, non-profits, federal government, andhospitals. Remote public entity and multi municipality collaborative thatapply for virtual net metering after December 31, 2018 will cease to receivedistribution kWh credit beginning January 1, 2050. Meter aggregation isgenerally allowed, and special provisions exist to accommodate meteraggregation for farm-based systems that serve facilities in close proximity toeach other.   **Community Remote Net Metering:**H.B. 8354, enacted in June 2016, authorizes community remote net metering inthe state. **Rate Design and Cost Allocation study**S.B. 81, enacted in June 2015, requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC)to consider rate design and distribution cost allocation among rate classestaking into account the effects of net metering and increasing distributedenergy resources. The PUC, in effect, established Docket 4545 and required theelectric utilities are required to file revenue-neutral allocated cost ofservice study of all rate classes and propose new rates for all customers ineach rate class. On January 2016, the PUC approved National Grid’s request towithdraw their proposed rate change filing, determining that no rate revisionwas required at this time. The PUC however, determined that it was importantto continue to review the issues raised in the proceeding, including ratedesign, net metering, and effects of distributed generation on the grid. Theproceeding can be accessed at Docket 4600.  * _Block Island Utility District's credit rate is similar to a feed-in tariff.

303,District of Columbia,DC,Renewable Portfolio Standard,"**History:**  In January 2005, the District of Columbia Council enacted a RenewablePortfolio Standard (RPS) that applies to all retail electricity sales in theDistrict. The RPS has been subsequently amended several times since. InOctober 2008 the RPS was amended by the Clean and Affordable Energy Act (CAEA)of 2008 which increased the percentage and number of benchmarks that utilitiesmust meet, including solar water heater as an eligible technology, increasedthe alternative compliance payment, and amended reporting requirements. In2010 D.C. Law 18-0223 made minor amendments clarifying the eligibility ofsolar thermal facilities within the District, and geographical eligibility ofrenewable resources in general. In March 2011 D.C. Law 18-0303 clarified thecertification requirements for non-residential solar thermal systems. InAugust of 2011, the RPS was amended by both the Emergency DistributedGeneration Amendment Act (B19-0384), and the Distributed Generation AmendmentAct (B19-10), which increased the solar carve out from 0.4% to 2.50% by 2023.In 2015 the D.C. Act 20-595 amended the definition of qualifying biomass byeliminating the use of black liquor and use of biomass from old, inefficientfacilities as an eligible biomass for a Tier 1 resource. In 2019, B22-0904made significant amendments to the RPS by expanding the Tier 1 RPS resource to100% by 2032 and the solar requirement to 10% by 2041.**Eligible technologies and Carve-outs:**District energy suppliers must meet the RPS by obtaining renewable energycredits (RECs) that equal the percentage requirement for electricity sold orby paying specified compliance fees. DC's RPS involves a two-tiered system.“Tier 1” renewable resources include solar (electric or thermal), wind,biomass (greater than 65% efficiency), landfill gas, waste-water treatmentgas, geothermal, ocean (mechanical and thermal), fuel cells fueled by ""Tier 1""resources, and wastewater used as a heat source as a sink for heating orcooling systems.Solar thermal installations must generally use Solar Rating and CertificationCorporation (SRCC) certified components in order to qualify as an eligibleresource. RECs are awarded to Solar Thermal based on their kWh savings at theratio 3,412 BTUs = 1kWh.“Tier 2” renewable resources include hydropower (other than pumped-storagegeneration). Municipal solid waste incineration was previously categorized aseligible Tier 2 resource, however, beginning in 2013 municipal solid waste wasno longer eligible as a Tier 2 resource.  After 2019, Tier 2 renewableresources will not be allowed to be applied toward meeting annual RPSrequirements.Specific minimum percentages of retail electricity sales must come fromeligible renewables according to the following schedule:Year | Tier I | Tier II | Solar  ---|---|---|---  2007 | 1.5% | 2.5% | 0.005%  2008 | 2.0% | 2.5% | 0.011%  2009 | 2.5% | 2.5% | 0.019%  2010 | 3.0% | 2.5% | 0.028%  2011 | 4.0% | 2.5% | 0.40%  2012 | 5.0% | 2.5% | 0.50%  2013 | 6.5% | 2.5% | 0.50%  2014 | 8.0% | 2.5% | 0.60%  2015 | 9.5% | 2.5% | 0.70%  2016 | 11.5% | 2.0% | 0.825%  2017 | 13.5% | 1.5% | 0.98%  2018 | 15.5% | 1.0% | 1.15%  2019 | 17.5% | 0.5% | 1.85%  2020 | 20.0% | 0.0% | 2.175%  2021 | 26.25% | 0.0% | 2.5%  2022 | 32.5% | 0.0% | 2.6%  2023 | 38.75% | 0.0% | 2.85%  2024 | 45.0% | 0.0% | 3.15%  2025 | 52.0% | 0.0% | 3.45%  2026 | 59.0% | 0.0% | 3.75%  2027 | 66.0% | 0.0% | 4.1%  2028 | 73.0% | 0.0% | 4.5%  2029 | 80.0% | 0.0% | 4.75%  2030 | 87.0% | 0.0% | 5.0%  2031 | 94.0% | 0.0% | 5.25%  2032 | 100% | 0.0% | 5.5%    The solar carve-out continues increasing beyond 2032, eventually requiring 10%in 2041 and thereafter.  Based on the final rulemaking issued by the PSC in case 945-E-2581, it appearsthat the solar requirement is contained within the Tier 1 requirement, meaningthat a solar REC used to comply with the solar requirement may also be used tomeet the Tier 1 requirement. Energy from Tier 1 resources is eligible forinclusion in meeting the RPS regardless of when the generating system orfacility was activated. Per 945-E-2581, to become a certified solar energysystem the system capacity must not be larger than 5MW and must either belocated within the District or in locations served by a distribution feederserving the District. Tier 1 energy may be applied to the percentagerequirements of the standard for either Tier 1 or Tier 2 renewable resources.RECs have a three-year lifetime from the date of generation during which theyare valid for compliance under the standard. The PSC RPS working group willidentify any renewable energy resource that has been both certified by anotherPJM state and is eligible for participation within the D.C. RPS. Annualfilings on Tier 1 and Tier 2 eligibility matrices will include thisinformation and will be made available by February 1 of each year. **Credit Multipliers:**Certain renewable resources have in the past received preferential treatmentthrough the use of compliance multipliers. Before January 1, 2007, electricitysuppliers received 120% credit toward meeting the RPS for energy generated bywind or solar. Between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2009, electricitysuppliers received 110% credit for energy generated by wind or solar. BeforeJanuary 1, 2010, electricity suppliers received 110% credit for energygenerated by landfill methane or wastewater-treatment methane.**Compliance:**Suppliers that fail to comply with the requirements must pay $0.05 perkilowatt-hour (kWh) of shortfall from required Tier 1 resources, $0.01 foreach kWh of shortfall from Tier 2 resources.Solar energy sources have a unique set of shortfall payment requirements, from2011 through 2016 at $0.50 per kWh, continue at $0.50 from 2016 through 2023,$0.40 in 2024 through 2028, $0.30 in 2029 through 2041, and $0.10 in 2042 andthereafter. Alternative compliance fees are deposited into the D.C. RenewableEnergy Development Fund and may be used to provide support to renewable energyprojects. Energy supply contracts entered into prior to August 1, 2011 willnot be subject to the increased solar requirements.In December 2005 the DC Public Service Commission (PSC) adopted interimregulations governing the implementation of the RPS, including the applicationand transfer of RECs. According to the regulations, the electricity supplierswere permitted by statute to begin receiving and accumulating RECs on January1, 2006. Effective October 1, 2010, RECs must be purchased from resourceslocated within the PJM Interconnection region or within a state adjacent tothe PJM Interconnection region. This portion of the law was amended by D.C.Law 18-0223 in July 2010 to remove confusing language pertaining to RECsassociated with electricity delivered into the PJM Interconnection region froman adjacent control area. These terms are defined in greater detail in therules adopted by the PSC.The PSC issued final regulations in January 2008 which require that eachelectricity supplier submit an annual compliance report detailing thequantities and types of renewable energy purchased and any compliance feesowed. Under these regulations, renewable energy generators must be certifiedas eligible by the PSC, but system owners may complete an expeditedcertification process if the generator has been previously certified by aneligible state with similar resource requirements. Further proposed rulechanges were issued by the PSC in April 2009 to address the legislativechanges made by the CAEA of 2008 with final revised rules adopted in September2009. PSC issued final regulations in May 2017 in response to the legislativechanges made by the Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act,which adds raw or treated wastewater used as a heat source or sink for aheating or cooling system as a Tier One renewable source, increases the solarenergy compliance fee starting with the 2017 compliance year, and increasesthe capacity of certain participating solar energy systems to fifteenmegawatts.The RPS program website contains a detailed summary of legislative andregulatory actions since the inception of the program.",Renewables Portfolio Standard,Regulatory Policy,1,https://dcpsc.org/Utility-Information/Electric/RPS.aspx,NA,2005

361,Iowa,IA,Iowa - Green Power Procurement,"In April 2005, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack issued Executive Order Number 41,directing state agencies to obtain at least 10% of their electricity fromrenewable energy sources by 2010. To satisfy this requirement, agenciesoriginally had the option of generating their own renewable energy orparticipating in an Iowa utility's green pricing program. However, in 2007 thestate attorney general determined that the purchasing option would violate theIowa Constitution. As a result, multiple state agencies are now in the processof developing on-site generation as a way to achieve the goal. All stateagencies are required to submit quarterly reports on their progress towardmeeting the goals of this policy. Renewable energy sources are defined in IowaCode Â§ 476.42. If an agency's utility already has a percentage of green powerin the fuel mix, the agency need only generate the remaining increment ofgreen power to meet the 10% goal. For example, if 7% of a utility'selectricity already comes from alternate energy sources, only the outstanding3% would be required. The order also directs state agencies to buy energy-efficient equipment and reduce energy use in buildings 15% by 2010, relativeto their energy use in 2000. Furthermore, under terms of the order, by 2010the state's light-duty vehicle fleets (vehicles other than heavy trucks) mustconsist of hybrid-electric vehicles and/or vehicles that use alternativefuels, with the exception of law-enforcement vehicles.

Companies with an electrical contractor license may engage in the business ofmaking electrical installations. Similarly a plumbing contractor licenseallows a company to engage in the business of making plumbing installations.Companies must also meet licensing and bonding requirements of theConstruction Contractors Board.    Individuals doing installations must hold a trade license. Solar electricinstallers must either hold an Electrical Journeyman's License or a LimitedRenewable Energy License (LRT). General Journeymen can do all aspects of solarelectric work, whereas the LRT license is limited to work on systems under 25kW AC. The Journeyman's license requires four years of general on-the-jobtraining whereas the LRT requires the completion of a two-year Oregonapprenticeship.    Solar thermal installers must either hold a Plumbing Journeyman's License or aSolar Heating and Cooling System Installer License (STL). General Journeymencan do all aspects of solar plumbing work, whereas the STL license is limitedto the non-potable side of systems.

Systems must be designedto offset part or all of a customer-generator's electricity requirements. Asystem is not eligible for net metering if its generating capacity exceeds thegreater of (1) the limit on demand that the class of customer of the customer-generator may place on the utility's system, or (2) 100% of the customer'sannual electricity demand.",Net Metering,Regulatory Policy,1,http://puc.nv.gov/Renewable_Energy/Net_Metering/,NA,NA
373,Nevada,NV,Energy Portfolio Standard,"Nevada established a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) as part of its 1997restructuring legislation. Under the standard, NV Energy (formerly NevadaPower and Sierra Pacific Power) must use eligible renewable energy resourcesto supply a minimum percentage of the total electricity it sells. In 2001, thestate increased the minimum requirement by 2% every two years, culminating ina 15% requirement by 2013. The portfolio requirement has been subsequentlyrevised, most significantly by SB 358 (2019), which increased the requirementto 50% by 2030. In addition to solar, qualifying renewable energy resourcesinclude biomass, geothermal energy, wind, certain hydropower, energy recoveryprocesses*, and waste tires (using microwave reduction).**    The following schedule is currently in effect:  * 6% renewables/efficiency in 2005 and 2006  * 9% renewables/efficiency in 2007 and 2008  * 12% renewables/efficiency in 2009 and 2010  * 15% renewables/efficiency in 2011 and 2012  * 18% renewables/efficiency in 2013 and 2014  * 20% renewables/efficiency in 2015 through 2019  * 22% renewables/efficiency in 2020   * 24% renewables/efficiency in 2021  * 29% renewables/efficiency in 2022 and 2023  * 34% renewables/efficiency in 2024 through 2026  * 42% renewables/efficiency in 2027 through 2029  * 50% renewables/efficiency in 2030 and each year thereafter **Energy Efficiency as an Eligible Resource**AB 3 (2005) allowed efficiency measures to be used to satisfy a portion of therequirement. To qualify as portfolio energy credits, efficiency measures mustbe: (1) implemented after January 1, 2005; (2) sited or implemented at aretail customer’s location; and (3) partially or fully subsidized by theelectric utility. The measure must also reduce the customer’s energy demand(as opposed to shifting demand to off-peak hours). The contribution fromenergy efficiency measures to meet the portfolio standard was originallycapped at one-quarter of the total standard in any particular year. SB 252(2013) established a schedule for reducing the extent to which energyefficiency can be used to comply with the standard, which was later amended byS.B. 358 of 2019. Energy efficiency measures can be used to comply with up to10% of the annual RPS requirement. Of that 10%, 50% must come from energyefficiency measures installed at residential customer service locations. Forcalendar year 2025 and each calendar year thereafter, no portion of thatamount may be based on energy efficiency measures. **Carve-Outs**At least 6% of the total renewable energy requirement must be met with solarenergy, starting in 2016. The requirement was 5% solar through 2015.**Portfolio Energy Credits and Credit Multipliers**The Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) has established a program toallow energy providers to buy and sell portfolio energy credits (PECs) inorder to meet energy portfolio requirements. One PEC represents one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated by a portfolio energy system, with theexception of customer-sited photovoltaics (PV) placed into service by 2015,for which 2.4 PECs are credited per one actual kWh of energy produced. Per SB252 (2013) this multiplier will end for new solar systems installed afterDecember 31, 2015, but will continue for existing solar PV systems. Forelectricity saved during peak periods as a result of efficiency measures, thecredit multiplier is 2.0.AB 388 (2013) clarified that the amount of energy provided by a system used incalculating PECs does not include any electricity generated by the system andused for its basic operations that reduce the amount of electricity deliveredto the grid. The legislation specifically excludes electricity used for theheating, lighting, air conditioning and equipment of a building located on thesite from portfolio eligibility, but specifically allows the electricity usedby a geothermal facility for the extraction and transportation of geothermalbrine or used to pump or compress geothermal brine. These amendments apply toany facility placed into service on or after January 1, 2016; however, systemswhich are placed into service after that date but had contracts in place priorto December 31, 2012 are grandfathered in.**350 Megawatt Requirement (NV Energy)**  Senate Bill 123 (2013) requires NV Energy to retire 800 megawatts (MW) ofcoal-fired electric generating plants, in phases, by December 31, 2019. Tooffset these retirements, the legislation requires the utility to purchase,construct, or aquire 900 MW of power, in phases, from cleaner facilities. Ofthis total, 350 MW must come from new renewable energy facilities. By the endof years 2014, 2015, and 2016, the utility must issue a request for proposalsfor 100 MW of generating capacity from new renewable energy facilities. Thefinal 50 MW of generating capacity from new renewable energy facilities mustbe owned and operated by the utility and construction must be completed byDecember 31, 2021. These requirements are separate from the 25% requirementunder the RPS, and the PECs associated with these projects can be used tocomply with the RPS.**Temporary Renewable Energy Development Program**  To help facilitate the renewable projects required by the renewable energyportfolio standard, the PUCN established the Temporary Renewable EnergyDevelopment (TRED) Program. The TRED Program is meant to insure prompt paymentto renewable energy providers in order to encourage completion of renewableenergy projects. The TRED Program establishes: (1) a TRED charge, allowinginvestor-owned utilities to collect revenue from electricity customers to payfor renewable energy separate from other wholesale power purchased by theelectric utilities; and (2) an independent TRED trust to receive the proceedsfrom the TRED charge and remit payment to renewable energy projects thatdeliver renewable energy to purchasing electric utilities.      * _The statutes define ""energy recovery processes"" as electricity generating systems with a nameplate capacity of 15 megawatts or less that convert the otherwise lost energy from ""the heat from exhaust stacks or pipes used for engines or manufacturing or industrial processes; or the reduction of high pressure in water or gas pipelines before the distribution of the water or gas."" To qualify, the system cannot use additional fossil fuel or require a combustion process to generate the electricity.__**Electricity produced from microwave reduction of tires must not involvecombustion of the tire, and is credited as 0.7 kWh of renewable energy forevery 1.0 kWh of actual electricity generated._",Renewables Portfolio Standard,Regulatory Policy,1,http://puc.nv.gov/Renewable_Energy/Portfolio_Standard/,NA,NA

461,Rhode Island,RI,Rhode Island Renewable Energy Fund (RIREF),"**Rhode Island Renewable Energy Fund**Rhode Island's Public Utilities Restructuring Act of 1996 created the nation'sfirst public benefits fund (PBF) for renewable energy and demand-sidemanagement (DSM). The Rhode Island Renewable Energy Fund's (RIREF) renewable-energy component is administered by the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation(Commerce RI) formerly known as the Economic Development Corporation (RIEDC),and the fund's demand-side management (DSM) programs are administered by thestate's electric and gas distribution companies, subject to review by theRhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC). **Funding and Budget**    CommerceRI’s Renewable Energy Fund (REF) is supported by a surcharge onelectric and gas customers' bills. Initially, the surcharge was was set at$0.0023 per kilowatt-hour (2.3 mills per kWh) and applied only to electricutilities. That funding supported both renewables and DSM programs. The lawwas amended in 2002 by establishing separate surcharges for renewables andDSM. The adjusted surcharge for renewables -- set at $0.0003 (0.3 mills) perkWh -- and the adjusted surcharge for DSM programs -- set at $0.002 (2.0mills) per kWh -- was initially scheduled to remain in effect for 10 years,beginning January 1, 2003. The annual budget for the renewables fund duringthis 10-year period was approximately $2.4 million. Beginning January 1, 2007,Rhode Island's gas-distribution utilities were required to include a surchargeof up to $0.15 per decatherm delivered. Legislation enacted in May 2011 (H.B.5281) removed the specific surcharge amounts for electric and gas DSMprograms. The PUC and utilities will determine appropriate surcharges. Thebill also extended the duration of the overall fund to January 1, 2018. **Offered Programs**  * Commercial Scale Projects  * Small Scale Projects  * Community Renewables  * Brownfields Solar PV ProgramRenewable-energy systems eligible for support from the RIREF includefacilities in the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) control area that generateelectricity using solar, solar thermal, solar space-heating, wind, wave,tidal, ocean-thermal, geothermal, hydro or sustainably-managed biomassresources.

Projects and activitiesdirectly related to implementing eligible renewable-energy projects in RhodeIsland also are eligible.**History**H.B. 7806 (2008) directed the RIEDC to integrate and coordinate the state'srenewable-energy policies -- including the RIREF, the Rhode Island RenewableElectricity Standard (RES) and the state's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative(RGGI) policy -- more effectively. For more information, see the RIEDC's5-Year Strategic Plan (2009-2013) for the RIREF.Legislation (H.B. 7806) enacted in July 2008 authorized the RIEDC to integrateand coordinate the state's renewable-energy policies more effectively. Thislaw required the RIEDC to create the Municipal Renewable Energy InvestmentProgram, using the lesser of 50% or $1 million collected annually from the 0.3mill per kWh surcharge for renewable-energy programs. This program providedgrants of up to $500,000 per project for municipal renewable-energy projects.The RIEDC created a second grant program, the Nonprofit Affordable HousingRenewable Energy Investment Program, using the lesser of 10% or $200,000collected annually from the 0.3 mill per kWh surcharge for renewablesprograms. In addition, the rules established by RIEDC provided funding (around$200,000 per year) to support pre-development consultant and technicalfeasibility studies.

488,Iowa,IA,Net Metering,"**Note: Iowa S.F. 583, enacted on March 12, 2020, makes substantial changesto net metering rules, which will go into effect by July 1, 2027 or whenstatewide distributed generation penetration reaches 5%, whichever is earlier;at that point value of solar methodologies will be developed. Utilities areallowed to file ""inflow-outflow"" tariffs in place of net metering before thatdate, but the compensation rate for outflow credits is equal to the volumetricretail rate until the value of solar is established. **In May 2017, the Iowa Utilities Board approved new net metering pilot programsfor MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy. These new programs make substantialchanges to the net metering rules offered by these utilities. The maximumsystem size limit has been increased to 1 MW from 500 kW; however, under bothprograms customers are not allowed to net meter more than 100% of their load.The two utilities measure the 100% cap differently; MidAmerican bases it onannual energy use, while Alliant bases it on maximum annual demand. The pilotprograms also make changes to excess generation compensation; whereaspreviously excess generation was carried over indefinitely, the new programsrequire an annual ""cash out"" where remaining excess generation is credited atan avoided cost rate.Iowa's statutes do not explicitly authorize the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) tomandate net metering, but this authority is implicit through the board'senforcement of PURPA and Iowa Code § 476.41 _et seq._ Iowa's net-meteringsubrule, adopted by the IUB in July 1984, applies to customers that generateelectricity using alternate energy production facilities (AEPs).**Eligibility and Availability**Net metering is available to customers of Iowa's two investor-owned utilities,MidAmerican Energy and Interstate Power and Light (IPL). MidAmerican Energy’snet metering tariff (Rate IO (Residential)/Rate QF (Non-residential)) isavailable here, and IPL's tariff (Rate IO) is available here.    There is no explicit limit on either the size of a net-metered system or ontotal enrollment in the IUB's subrule. However, separate rule waivers haveallowed MidAmerican Energy and IPL to limit individual systems to 1 megawatt(MW). Customers that have an on-site renewable energy system through anexisting third-party power purchase agreement are not eligible for netmetering under the existing net metering tariffs of MidAmerican and IPL. IPLalso limits net metering to customers on the Residential, Farm, or GeneralService rate schedules, so customers on the Large General Service rateschedule (i.e., customers using more than 20,000 kWh per month) are ineligibleto net meter.According to the IUB, net metering is available to approximately 89% ofresidential customers in Iowa (see Docket No. NOI-2014-0001, “Order SolicitingAdditional Comments and Scheduling Workshop,” **** p. 6). The IUB has so fardeclined to assert jurisdiction over net metering policies for non-rate-regulated utilities (i.e., electric cooperatives and municipal utilities), butstrongly encourages them to adopt net metering policies on a voluntary basis.**Net Excess Generation**Although Iowa's net-metering subrule requires utilities to purchase acustomer’s net excess generation (NEG) at the utility's _avoided cost rate_ ,subsequent rule waivers allow MidAmerican Energy and IPL customers to carryNEG forward for use in future months as a kilowatt-hour (kWh) credit. The netmetering kWh offset effectively provides a credit at the customer's _retailelectricity rate_ ; however, MidAmerican and IPL customers cannot cash out anyexcess credits.**Interconnection**An overview of Iowa’s interconnection guidelines can be found here.",Net Metering,Regulatory Policy,1,https://iub.iowa.gov/regulated-industries/electric/site-distributed-generation,NA,1984

731,Oregon,OR,EWEB - PV Partners,"The Eugene Water & Electric Board (EWEB) began the PV Partners program in2000. The program's broad goal was to develop and implement an education anddemonstration program of distributed solar electric technology as the firststep leading to wide spread use of distributed photovoltaic resources inEugene, Oregon. The program's objectives included public education, testing ofutility interconnection standards and policies, identification of the valueand benefits to EWEB and individual customers, and exploration of fundingopportunities and partnerships. The PV Partners program gives all customers,within EWEB's service territory, the opportunity to generate electricity (fromphotovoltaic sources only), offset their electric needs and receive credit forany excess electricity generated. The systems are net-metered, using a singlemeter that is capable of running backwards. PV Partners receives the fullbenefit of the electricity generated by the systems. The policy describes thethree methods that the excess generation may be credited. The excessgeneration rate is $ .06181 per kWh. To date, partially because of system sizeand/or length time installed, there has not been a customer with net excessgeneration. Accounts are manually monitored and trued up on an annual basis.Currently, 5 residential customers, 1 commercial customer, 1 non-profitcustomer and 3 schools have installed photovoltaic systems totalling 30.6 kW.The goal is to install 90 kW by 2006. There is no minimum size requirement foreach system. The maximum size limit for PV Partners is 25KW which correspondswith the net-metering legislation.

780,Delaware,DE,Interconnection Guidelines,"_**NOTE: Delaware law (26 Del. C. § 1014) requires the Delaware Public ServiceCommission (PSC), Delaware Electric Cooperative (DEC), and municipal utilitiesto develop interconnection rules using as a guide the Interstate RenewableEnergy Council's (IREC) model interconnection rules and the U.S. Department ofEnergy's best practices for interconnection. This entry largely addresses therules used by Delmarva Power, the state's largest utility. **_    Delmarva, Delaware's only investor-owned electric utility, has four basiclevels of interconnection based on system size and system type (inverter-basedor non-inverter-based). In June 2011 the PSC issued Order No. 7984 approvingfinal revised rules to implement net energy metering pursuant to therequirements of S.B. 267. Order No. 7984 provides, among other things, thatDelmarva would file revised tariffs, applicable Interconnection Standards forGenerators, and such other forms as may be necessary to comply with Order No.7984 within 30 days of the July 10, 2011 publication of these final rules inthe Delaware Register of Regulations.Effective August 8, 2011, Delmarva's new guidelines apply to interconnectionsof all types of distributed generation systems of less than 10 MW to theelectric distribution system for the utility. Delmarva now utilizes a four-tiered approach to determine the level of review required before a system maybe connected to the grid. Different levels of review are subject to specifictechnical screens, review procedures, and time lines. Generally speaking, thereview process becomes more extensive and time consuming with increasingsystem size. Below are the basic criteria* for determining the level of reviewrequired for a prospective project.  * **Level 1** : Lab certified, inverter-based systems with a nameplate capacity of 10 kW or less.  * **Level 2** : Lab certified or field inverter-based systems with a nameplate capacity of 2 MW or less connected to a radial distribution circuit or to a spot network serving one customer. Alternatively, the system was reviewed and not approved under Level 1.  * **Level 3** : Only applies to systems that will not export power to the grid and which do not require new facility construction by the utility. Systems being located on an area network must be inverter-based, use lab certified equipment, and have a nameplate capacity of 50 kW or less.These systems must have an aggregate generation of 5% of an area network's maximum load or 50kW, which ever is less. Systems located on a radial network must have a capacity of 10 MW or less and not be served by a shared transformer. These systems are also subject to additional criteria dealing with the aggregate capacity of interconnected systems on a given network.  * **Level 4** : Systems with a nameplate capacity of 10 MW or less that cannot be approved or do not meet the criteria for review under a lower tier.An interconnection request may be eligible for expedited review if smallgenerator facilities use lab certified equipment or field approvedinterconnection equipment. Lab certified equipment is defined to meanequipment tested and approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory(NRTL) as being in accordance with IEEE 1547, UL 1741, and the NationalElectric Code (NEC). Field approved systems are generally non-certifiedsystems that have been tested and approved under a review by a utility overthe last 36 months and are subject to certain other restrictions includingutility witness tests. All interconnected systems must be equipped with autility accessible ""lockable, visible-break isolation device"" or alternately,a ""draw-out type circuit breaker with a provision for padlocking at the draw-out position"". This requirement is equivalent to ""lockable external disconnectswitch"" frequently specified in other jurisdictions.Utilities may not charge any processing fees to Level 1 applicants andprocessing fees are limited to $50 plus $1/kilowatt (kW) of capacity for Level2 requests and $100 plus $2/kW of capacity for Level 3 and 4 requests. Theregulations also contain provisions for dispute resolution, record retentionand utility reporting requirements.Additional insurance requirements vary by the Level of interconnection. TheLevel 1 interconnection agreement specifically states that applicants are notrequired to obtain general liability insurance as a condition ofinterconnection approval, however Delmarva does advise its customers toconsider obtaining appropriate coverage to cover potential liability. Forsmall generator facilities with a nameplate capacity of 1MW or above, thecustomer is required to carry adequate insurance coverage. Section 7 of theinterconnection agreement for Levels 2, 3 and 4 requires continuous liabilityinsurance of at least $2 million per occurrence and $4 million in aggregatefor systems of 1 MW or larger. Section 7 also specifies that the policy mustname the utility as an additional insured party.**Delaware Electric Cooperatives**Delaware Electric Cooperative's (DEC) interconnection guidelines are similarto Delmarva's old guidelines. For renewable-energy generators 25 kW or less,systems must comply with all applicable safety and performance standardsestablished by the National Electric Code (NEC), IEEE and UL. These systemsare also eligible for net metering. DEC customers with systems greater than 25kW are required to carry at least $1 million in liability insurance peroccurrence and $1 million in property-loss insurance. Higher amounts ofcoverage may be required at the discretion of the DEC, although S.B. 8 statesthat utilities are not permitted to require ""customers who meet all applicablesafety and performance standards to install excessive controls, perform or payfor unnecessary tests, or purchase excessive liability insurance"". An externaldisconnect switch is required for systems larger than 25 kW.

791,Nevada,NV,Interconnection Standards,"In December 2003, the Nevada Public Utilities Commission (PUC) adoptedinterconnection standards for customers of NV Energy (formerly Nevada Powerand Sierra Pacific Power) with on-site generation up to 20 megawatts (MW) incapacity. These standards are largely consistent with IEEE 1547 standards,California's interconnection rule (California Rule 21) and the modelinterconnection agreement developed by the National Association of RegulatoryUtility Commissioners (NARUC). Significantly, the PUC determined that NVEnergy may assess customer-generators for past fuel and purchased-powerexpenses in tariffs. NV Energy has incorporated the standards into theirtariffs as Rule 15.    The interconnection standards approved by the PUC also updated Nevada's net-metering policy, originally enacted in 1997. Nevada Revised Statute 704.774addresses basic interconnection requirements for net-metered renewable-energysystems with a maximum capacity of 10 kilowatts. This statute requires net-metered systems to meet standards established by the Institute of Electricaland Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the National Electrical Code (NEC), andUnderwriters Laboratories (UL). Customers who complied with these guidelinescould not be required to install additional equipment (such as a manualexternal disconnect switch), abide by additional safety requirements orpurchase additional liability insurance. An October 2008 PUC order furtherclarified the issue of liability by specifically requiring the removal of anytariffs' obligation that the utility be named as an additional insured on thecustomer's insurance.",Interconnection,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA
802,Oregon,OR,Interconnection Standards,"Oregon has three separate interconnection standards: one for net-meteredsystems; one for small generator facilities (non-net metered systems); and onefor large generator facilities (non-net metered systems). Oregon has alsoestablished separate net metering requirements and interconnection standardsfor the state's primary investor-owned utilities (PGE and PacifiCorp), and forits municipal utilities and electric cooperatives.    **Interconnection for Net Metered Systems**    **_PGE and PacifiCorp Customers_**    The Oregon Public Utilities Commission (PUC) adopted new rules for netmetering for PGE and PacifiCorp customers in July 2007 with Order 07-319,raising the individual system capacity limit from 25 kilowatts (kW) to twomegawatts (MW) for non-residential applications. (The rules do not apply tocustomers of Idaho Power, which provides net metering to Oregon customerspursuant to rules adopted by the Idaho Public Utilities Commission.) The limiton individual residential systems is 25 kW. Systems that generate electricityusing solar power, wind power, hydropower, fuel cells or biomass resources areeligible. Net metered systems must be intended primarily to offset part or allof a customer's requirements for electricity. Utilities may not limit theaggregate capacity of net metered systems.    The PUC rules include three levels of interconnection for net-metered systems,and require the use of a standard application, a standard agreement, andreasonable procedural timelines for utilities and applicants. Each utilitymust designate an employee or office from which an applicant can obtain basicapplication forms and information through an informal process. With theexception of certain inverter-based systems 25 kW or less, a manual, externaldisconnect switch is required. Utilities may not require customers to purchaseadditional liability insurance or to name the utility as an ""additionalinsured"" on the customer's liability policy.    Oregon's rules provide for three levels of interconnection review:  * Level 1: applies to certified, inverter-based systems up to 25 kW in capacity that comply with IEEE standards and UL 1741. A system is considered ""certified"" if it has been tested and listed by a nationally recognized testing lab. Systems must pass specific technical screens. Utilities may not charge application fees or other fees for Level 1 review.  * Level 2: applies to certified systems up to 2 MW that comply with IEEE standards and UL 1741, as applicable, but do not qualify for Level 1 review. A system is considered ""certified"" if it has been tested and listed by a nationally recognized testing lab. Systems must pass specific technical screens. Interconnection to area networks is permitted, with limitations. Utilities may charge fees of up to $50 plus $1 per kW of system capacity, plus ""the reasonable cost of any required minor modifications to the electric distribution system or additional review."" Costs for engineering work performed as part of an impact study or interconnection facilities study are limited to $100 per hour.  * Level 3: applies to systems that do not qualify for Level 1 review or Level 2 review. Systems must pass specific technical screens. Interconnection to area networks is permitted, with limitations. Utilities may charge fees of up to $100 plus $2 per kW of system capacity, plus charges for time spent on any required impact or facilities studies. Costs for engineering work performed as part of an impact study or interconnection facilities study are limited to $100 per hour. If a utility must install facilities in order to accommodate the interconnection of a system, the applicant must pay for the costs of such facilities.  **_Customers of Municipal Utilities, Cooperatives and People 's UtilityDistricts_**    Oregon's municipal utilities, electric cooperatives and people's utilitydistricts must offer customers net metering pursuant to OR Revised Statutes757.300. Systems that generate electricity using solar power, wind power,hydropower, fuel cells or biomass resources are eligible. Net-metered systemsmust be intended primarily to offset part or all of a customer's requirementsfor electricity. The aggregated capacity of all net-metered systems is limitedto 0.5% of a utility's historic single-hour peak load.    The Oregon Building Codes Division has developed interconnection guidelinesfor all utilities. Systems must be installed according to the Oregon ElectricSpecialty Code (essentially NEC Article 690) and relevant IEEE standards, andmust employ UL-listed equipment. A manual external disconnect switch is notrequired in the guidelines, but some utilities require this switch in theirtariffs. Additional liability insurance is not required. Utilities are exemptfrom any liability for loss, injury or death related to the interconnection ofa net-metered system.    **Interconnection for Small Generator Facilities**    In June 2009, the PUC issued Order No. 09-196 and adopted administrative rulesfor the interconnection of small generator facilities up to 10 MW. These ruleswere finalized in September 2009, when the PUC approved changes made to thethree investor-owned utilities' interconnection forms and agreements. WhileIdaho Power is not subject to the interconnection standards for net meteredsystems, it is subject to these standards. There are four tiers of review forsmall generating facilities, based on system capacity: 25 kW, 2 MW, non-exporting systems up to 10 MW, and other systems. Application fees aredifferentiated, based on tier. The maximum application fee is $100 for Tier 1,$500 for Tier 2, and $1000 for Tiers 3 and 4. There may be additional costs ifan evaluation is required, but the applicant must agree to this cost prior tothe evaluation being conducted. The rules for the first two tiers mirror theinterconnection standards for net-metered systems.    **Interconnection for Large Generator Facilities**    In April 2010, the PUC issued Order No. 10-132 for the interconnection oflarge generator facilities, defined as systems larger than 20 MW. The PUCapproved interconnection procedures and a standard interconnection agreementbased on FERC's Large Generator Interconnection Procedures and Large GeneratorInterconnection Agreement.",Interconnection,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA

946,Iowa,IA,Interconnection Standards,"The Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) adopted rules for utilities in May 2010 for theinterconnection of distributed generation facilities in Iowa. Theinterconnection rules were most recently updated in 2017.  **Rate-Regulated Utilities**Rate-regulated utilities include the state's two investor-owned utilities,MidAmerican Energy and Interstate Power and Light (IPL), and Linn County RuralElectric Cooperative, which opted to have the IUB set its rates. The rates ofmunicipal utilities and other rural electric cooperatives are not regulated bythe IUB.**Process**Interconnection standards for rate-regulated utilities apply to distributedgeneration facilities of up to 10 megawatts (MW)* that are not subject to theinterconnection requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC), the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO), orthe Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP). A distributed generation facilityincludes qualifying facilities (QFs) under the U.S. Public UtilitiesRegulatory Policy Act (PURPA) and alternative energy production (AEP)facilities, which are electricity generation facilities that derive at least75% of their energy input from solar, wind, waste management, resourcerecovery, refuse-derived fuel, agricultural crops or residues, or woodburning, as well as dam-based hydroelectric facilities.    The Iowa rules set four levels of review for interconnection requests. Aproject must meet all of the requirements of a given classification in orderto be eligible for that level of review. The level of review required isgenerally based on system capacity, whether system components are certified bya nationally recognized testing laboratory (NRTL), and whether the system isconnected to a radial distribution circuit or to an area network. The basicdefinitions for each tier are as follows (see IAC § 199-45 for full details):  * **Level 1** : Lab-certified, inverter-based systems with a capacity rating of 20 kilowatts (kW) or less;  * **Level 2** : Lab-certified, non-inverter-based systems with a capacity rating of 2 MW or less, connected to a radial distribution network or a spot network serving one customer, and lab-certified, inverter-based systems with capacity ranging from 500 kW to 5 MW depending on line voltage and position on a mainline;  * **Level 3** : Lab-certified, inverter-based systems with a capacity rating of 50 kW or less which are connected to an area network and which will not export power; or lab-certified, non-exporting systems connected to a radial distribution circuit where the aggregate total of all generator nameplate capacity is no more than 10 MW (including the distributed generator applicant); and  * **Level 4** : Systems with a capacity of 10 MW or less that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in a lower tier, including all systems using non-lab-certified components and those that require additional construction by the utility in order accommodate the facility.The rules adopt IEEE 1547-2003 as the technical standard for evaluatinginterconnection requests. Systems are considered to be lab-certified if theequipment has been tested successfully in accordance with IEEE 1547.1 orcertified as compliant with UL-1741 by a nationally recognized testinglaboratory (NRTL). The rules also specify the technical screens which may beapplied to applications at each level of review as well as time limits fordifferent stages of the evaluation process. Generally speaking, the higher thetier, the more intensive the screening process and the longer the time ittakes for an application to be approved.    **Disconnect Device**A lockable external disconnect switch (EDS) may be required at the utility'sdiscretion, and the utility is permitted to make reasonable system monitoringand control requirements for systems larger than 1 MW. In addition, systemswith a design capacity of 100 kW or less must be equipped with a device thatautomatically disconnects the system from the electric grid upon a loss ofutility-supplied voltage.In 2015, Iowa enacted H.F. 548, which required the IUB to implement rulesrequiring distributed generation installations placed in service on or afterJuly 1, 2015, have a disconnection device installed at a location that iseasily visible and adjacent to an interconnection customer's electric meter.**Fees**The IUB develops standardized interconnection applications and agreements.Application fees are set at $125 plus up to an additional $125 if the utilityperforms a witness test for Level 1 applications; $250 plus $1 per kW and upto an additional $125 if the utility performs a witness test for Level 2applications; $500 plus $2 per kW for Level 3 applications; and $1,000 plus $2per kW for Level 4 applications. Utilities are required to designate a pointof contact for system interconnections and provide contact information on theutility web site.**Liability Insurance**All applicants are required to provide proof of some type of general liabilityinsurance as part of the interconnection agreement. For facilities of lessthan 1 MW, homeowner's insurance is referred to by the rules as one acceptableform of general liability insurance without any specific minimum amount ofcoverage. For facilities of 1 MW or larger, the customer must maintain ageneral liability insurance policy with a limit of at least $2,000,000 peroccurrence and at least $4,000,000 in aggregate and name the utility as anadditional insured party.    **Non-Rate-Regulated Utilities**General interconnection rules that apply to both rate-regulated and non-rate-regulated utilities in Iowa are found in IAC § 199-15.10 and cover QFs and AEPfacilities. The rules are limited in scope, covering power quality and safetyissues such as specifying the use IEEE 1547-2003 as the technical standard forinterconnection evaluations, allowing utilities discretion to require theinstallation of an EDS, requiring facilities of 100 kW or less to haveautomatic disconnect capability upon the loss of grid voltage, grantingutilities site access rights for inspection and testing, and allowingutilities to disconnect facilities in emergency situations.Beginning January 1, 2013, all AEP facilities must provide advanced notice offacility construction or installation. Facilities that will be attacheddirectly or indirectly to an electric transmission or distribution line in apublic utility's service territory must notify the utility at least a 30 daysprior to the commencement of construction or installation. Facilities with apower purchase agreement with the utility are exempt from this requirement.  _*The actual language of the rules states generation capacity in terms of MVAor kVA, as opposed to MW or kW. In addition, while the standard rules onlyapply to systems up to 10 MW, they state that interconnection of largerfacilities should take place using the Level 4 review process and agreement asa starting point, supplemented with mutually agreed upon modifications on thepart of the customer and the utility._",Interconnection,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA

Under the Energy Replacement Generation Tax Exemption, the followingfacilities are exempt from the replacement tax:  * All energy generated by methane gas conversion property to the extent the property is used in connection or conjunction with a publicly-owned sanitary landfill or used to collect waste that would otherwise be collected by or deposited with a publicly-owned sanitary landfill,  * Wind energy conversion property that is eligible for a tax credit or that is subject to the special valuation of wind energy conversion property, and  * Facilities owned by or leased to a state university or university of science and technology, to the extent electricity generated by such facilities is consumed exclusively by such state university or university of science and technology,    * Self-generators with on-site facilities. In order to qualify for the exemption, self-generators must wholly own or lease the facility in question and produce electricity solely for their own consumption, except for inadvertent unscheduled deliveries to their electric utility. However, facilities that do not consume all energy on-site are not required to pay the replacement tax on energy that is used to operate the facility.In addition, large hydroelectric generators (100 megawatts or more) pay areduced generation tax equivalent to $0.000001847 per kWh.",Corporate Tax Exemption,Financial Incentive,1,https://tax.iowa.gov/,NA,NA
1036,Nevada,NV,Portfolio Energy Credits,"Nevada's Energy Portfolio Standard requires NV Energy to derive or save aminimum percentage of the electricity it sells from renewable energy resourcesor energy efficiency measures. Included in the standard is a Portfolio EnergyCredit (PC) trading program.  Beginning January 1, 2003, Nevada's renewable energy producers can earn PCs,which can then be sold to utilities that are required to meet Nevada'sportfolio standard. One PC represents one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricitygenerated, with the exception of the multipliers described below.Each kWh generated by a photovoltaic (PV) system installed on the premises ofa retail customer on or before December 31, 2015 will be credited with 2.4PCs. This multiplier will end for new solar systems installed after that date,but will continue for existing net metered solar PV systems. Customer-maintained distributed renewable energy systems receive a 0.05 adder for eachkilowatt-hour generated. For example, a distributed PV system that is alsocustomer-maintained would be credited 2.45 for each kilowatt-hour generated.Energy efficiency resources receive a multiplier of 1.05, and a multiplier of2.0 if they save electricity during periods of peak utility load. Solarthermal energy systems are credited with 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity foreach 3,412 British thermal units of heat generated. Finally, each kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by eligible waste tire facilities is credited at0.7.In order to participate, owners of renewable energy systems must contact thePublic Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) to register their system. A verysimple application form is available on the PUCN web site. The value of a PCis market-driven.  Owners of PV, wind, or hydro systems installed through NV Energy'sRenewableGenerations (rebate) Program do not retain the PCs associated withtheir electricity generation, and thus are not eligible to trade certificatesthrough this program.

1058,District of Columbia,DC,Interconnection Standards,"In July 2006 the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (PSC)initiated a formal inquiry into the development of uniform interconnectionprocedures for on-site distributed generation systems. The PSC subsequentlyconcluded that an interconnection standard was feasible and continued with therule making process, culminating with the adoption of final interconnectionregulations in February 2009 (DC PSC Order No. 15182). The rules apply to alldistributed generation systems of 10 megawatts (MW) or smaller that areoperated in parallel with the electric distribution system and are not subjectto the interconnection requirements of the PJM Interconnection.    The interconnection rules set four levels of review for interconnectionrequests. A project must meet all of the requirements of a givenclassification in order to be eligible for that level of expedited review. Thelevel of review required is generally based on system capacity, whether systemcomponents are certified, and the type of distribution circuit to which afacility will be connected. The basic definitions* for each level are asfollows:  * Level 1: Certified, inverter-based systems with a capacity rating of 10 kilowatts (kW) or less.  * Level 2: Certified systems with a capacity of 2 MW or less, connected to a radial distribution network or a spot network serving one customer. Area network connections are not permitted under Level 2.  * Level 3: Only applies to systems that will not export power to the grid. For area networks (3A), systems must be certified and have a capacity of 50 kW or less; _or_ for radial distribution networks (3B), systems must have a capacity rating of 10 MW or less.  * Level 4: Systems with a capacity of 10 MW or less that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in a lower tier, generally including all systems that require additional construction by the utility in order accommodate the facility.The interconnection regulations generally use IEEE 1547 as a technicalstandard for evaluation of all levels of interconnection. Systems areconsidered to be lab-certified if the components have been evaluated by anationally recognized testing laboratory as compliant with UL 1741 (inverters)and IEEE 1547.1. The rules specify the technical screens which may be appliedto applications at each level of review and time limits for different stagesof the evaluation process. Generally speaking, higher level applications aresubject to more intensive screening and longer time limits.    A lockable external disconnect switch is not required for Level 1interconnections, but is required for Levels 2 - 4\. Facilities larger than 1MW must carry general liability insurance with coverage of at least $2 millionper occurrence and $4 million in aggregate, and the policy must also name theutility as an additional insured party. Standardized interconnectionagreements are available for all four levels of review and are available inthe February 2009 PSC Notice of Final Rulemaking. The interconnectionagreements for all four levels are attached to the final rules. The rules andaccompanying standard forms also contain details regarding application feesand avenues for dispute resolution.    **History**  The PSC adopted net-metering rules in February 2005 for residential andcommercial electric customers with renewable-energy systems, fuel cells,cogeneration and microturbines up to 100 kilowatts (kW) in capacity. InJanuary 2007 the PSC approved a net-metering tariff filed by Pepco -- the onlyelectric distribution company that serves the District -- which also containedcertain technical standards for net metered facilities. Prior to this, in2003, Pepco had filed an interconnection tariff to address larger qualifyingfacilities (QFs) under PURPA.    _*The definitions here cover several important classification criteria;however, interested parties should consult the actual rule for more precisedefinitions and additional restrictions._",Interconnection,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA
1059,Connecticut,CT,Interconnection Standards,"In December 2007, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC)now called the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) approved newinterconnection guidelines for distributed energy systems up to 20 megawatts(MW) in capacity. Connecticut's interconnection guidelines apply to thestate's two investor-owned utilities -- Connecticut Light and Power Company(CL&P) and United Illuminating Company (UI) -- and are modeled on the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) interconnection standards for smallgenerators.*    Connecticut's interconnection guidelines, like FERC's standards, includeprovisions for three levels of systems:  * Certified, inverter-based systems no larger than 10 kilowatts (kW) in capacity (application fees: $100);  * Certified systems no larger than 2 megawatts (MW) in capacity (application fees: $500); and  * All other systems no larger than 20 MW in capacity. Note that the guidelines include ""additional process steps"" for generators greater than 5 MW (application fees: $1000, study fees will also apply).Connecticut's guidelines include a standard interconnection agreement andapplication fees that vary by system type. However, Connecticut's guidelinesare stricter than FERC's standards, differing from the federal standards inseveral significant ways:  * Customers are required to install an external disconnect switch and an interconnection transformer.  * Customers must indemnify their utility against ""all causes of action,"" including personal injury or property damage to third parties.  * Customers are required to maintain liability insurance in specified amounts based on the system's capacity.  * In addition, the utilities were required to collaboratively submit to the PURA a status report on the research and development of area network interconnection standards. This report was completed in December 2009, and the PURA has reached a final decision (03-01-15RE02) on the docket. The PURA has determined that the utilities can interconnect inverter-based generators (up to 50 kW) on area networks.The guidelines address requirements for study fees and include technicalscreens for each level of interconnection. Utilities and customers must followgeneral procedural timelines._For systems 10 kW or less_ : Interconnections are provided in a first-come,first-serve basis in a non-discriminatory manner. The interconnection requiresapproval from the Municipal Electrical Inspector and a witness from theutility. After completion of the interconnection request, the utility has 10business days to respond to the request, or the commissioning test is waived.The interconnection must be in compliance with local, state, federal andutility safety rules including the IEE 1574. The customers are required tomaintain a liability insurance of $300,000 per interconnection. Totalapplication fee of $100 is required for the process. The guidelines forinterconnection for generation facilities less than 10 kW can be accessed_here_._For systems 10kW - 20MW_: Interconnection process for systems greater than10kW varies depending on the generation location, size, and customerrequirements. Depending where the customer wants to interconnect, the systemcould fall under either FERC jurisdiction or State jurisdiction. Generatorswho want to interconnect to sell electricity the wholesale market fall underFERC jurisdiction and must submit application to ISO NE, while customers undernet-metering rules or under DUPC approved tariff are subject to Stateregulation and must submit application to their utilities. Systems smallerthan 2MW with meet provided codes and standards have the option for fast trackreview process.  All generating facilities are required to maintain generalliability insurance that range from $300,000 to $5,000,000 depending on thesize. General guideline for interconnection for systems larger than 10kW canbe accessed _here. __For systems greater than 20 MW:_  A standard procedure for interconnectionfor generation systems greater than 20 MW has not been developed, since largegenerators rarely interconnect with the utility. However in such case, theutility will use its general guidelines to conduct its review with time framesand feasibility studies adjusted accordance with the ISO NE Tariff, schedule22.  _*FERC's interconnection standards are applicable to generatorinterconnections subject to FERC jurisdiction, whereas Connecticut'sinterconnection guidelines apply to state-jurisdiction interconnections, whichtypically occur at the distribution level.

1078,Connecticut,CT,Connecticut Green Power Purchase Plan,"In April 2004, Connecticut's governor signed an executive order directingstate government agencies and universities to purchase an increasing amount ofelectricity generated by renewable resources. Under terms of the order, thestate government has a goal to increase ""Class I"" renewable energy purchasesto 20% of electricity used in 2010, 50% in 2020 and 100% in 2050. The orderalso authorizes the use of savings generated by state energy efficiency andconservation projects to fund green power purchases.    Class I renewable energy resources include solar, wind, new sustainablebiomass, landfill gas, fuel cells (using renewable or non-renewable fuels),ocean thermal power, wave or tidal power, low-emission advanced renewable-energy conversion technologies, and new run-of-the-river hydropower facilitieswith a maximum capacity of five megawatts (MW).    In 2006, Governor Rell issued Connecticut's Energy Vision for a Cleaner,Greener State, which sets a separate set of goals for the state. Specifically,it states that by 2020, 20% of all energy used and sold in the State will comefrom green renewable (clean) resources. See the Energy Vision for additionalgoals.    The State of Connecticut has made the Environmental Protection Agency'sNational Top 50 Green Power Partnership (R) list from 2009-2014.

Beginning 2019, and every five years thereafter,the PUC could determine if there was adequate renewable energy supply to meetthe increase in percentage requirement for the following year. If the PUCdetermined that there was an inadequate amount of renewable energy supply thenthe PUC could delay all or part of the percentage increase until the resourcesupply was determined to be adequate. The PUC exercised this ability in 2014,delaying 2015's scheduled increase of 1.5%. For 2015, RES obligated entitieswere required to obtain 8.5% percentage (same as 2014) of electricity soldfrom eligible renewable resources. This order resulted in delay of allsubsequent increase in RPS goals by one year, thus decreasing the original2022 target of 20.5% to 19%. S.B. 2274 removed this authority from the PUC;the PUC can no longer delay the annual increases.Year | % Requirement | Year | % Requirement | Year | % Requirement  ---|---|---|---|---|---  2007 | 3% | 2016 | 10% | 2025  | 34%    2008 | 3.5% | 2017 | 11.5% | 2026  | 41%    2009 | 4% | 2018 | 13% | 2027  | 48%    2010 | 4.5% | 2019 | 14.5% | 2028  | 55.5%    2011 | 5.5% | 2020 | 16% | 2029  | 63.5%    2012 | 6.5% | 2021 | 17.5% | 2030  | 72%    2013 | 7.5% | 2022 | 19% | 2031  | 81%    2014 | 8.5% | 2023 | 23% | 2032  | 90.5%    2015 | 8.5% | 2024  | 28%  | 2033  | 100%    Table: Rhode Island Renewable Energy Standard annual obligation.  **Eligible technologies:**  Eligible renewable resources include:  * Direct solar radiation  * Wind  * Movement or the latent heat of the ocean  * The earth's heat  * Hydroelectric facilities up to 30 megawatts (MW) in capacity  * Biomass facilities using eligible biomass fuels and maintaining compliance with current air permits (eligible biomass fuels may be co-fired with fossil fuels, provided that only the renewable-energy portion of production from multi-fuel facilities will be considered eligible)  * Fuel cells using renewable resource**RES Targets by compliance year****Compliance:**For each obligated entity and in each compliance year, and for the purposes ofmeeting the RES, the amount of retail electricity sales derived from eligiblerenewable resources initially placed into commercial operation before December31, 1997, may not exceed 2% of total retail electricity sales. Compliance withthe RES may also be achieved through the purchase of New England Power PoolGeneration Information System (NEPOOL-GIS) certificates or by making analternative compliance payment of $64.02 per megawatt-hour (2012) to thestate's Renewable Energy Development Fund. Voluntary green-power purchases maynot be counted toward RES compliance. Annual compliance reports are availableon the PUC web site shown above.**Long-term contracts:**    A separate and distinct standard established in June 2009 (""Long-TermContracting Standard for Renewable Energy"") requires electric distributioncompanies to solicit proposals and enter into long-term contracts forcapacity, energy and attributes from new renewable energy facilities. Electricdistribution companies will be required to enter into long-term contracts for90 MW in capacity by 2014, of which 3 MW must come from in-state solarfacilities. Distribution companies will be required to meet the followingannual benchmarks, provided acceptable, commercially reasonable proposals havebeen received:  * 22.5 MW contracted by 12/30/2010 (25% of the total required amount)  * 45 MW contracted by 12/30/2011 (50% of the total required amount)  * 67.5 MW contracted by 12/30/2012 (75% of the total required amount), and  * 90 MW contracted by 12/30/2013 (100% of the requirement).Beginning of 2014, the electric distribution companies (EDCs) shall conductsolicitations until 100% of the minimum long term contract capacity is met,however if the contract price is above the forecasted market price of therenewable energy certificates and energy over the term of the contract thenthe EDCs may choose to acquire environmental attributes and energy instead ofcapacity contract.Each long-term contract must be reviewed and approved by the PUC. All energyand capacity purchased must be sold immediately by the distribution companyinto the wholesale spot market. Or, with PUC approval, the distributioncompany may re-sell the energy and capacity to customers. The NEPOOL-GIScertificates purchased under the long-term contract must be sold through acompetitive bid process, or with PUC approval, may be used to meet thedistribution company's RES obligations.      _* RES increases in 2011 and subsequent years are subject to the PUC'sfindings._",Renewables Portfolio Standard,Regulatory Policy,1,http://www.ripuc.ri.gov/utilityinfo/res.html,NA,2004

The output from generators of less than 100 kW may beaggregated for RPS compliance. The PSC will certify generation units as""eligible energy resources"". Certified generators are entitled to a renewableenergy credit (REC) for each megawatt-hour (MWh) of energy they generate.Delaware RECs are tracked by the PJM-EIS Generation Attributes Tracking System(GATS). A REC can generally be used for RPS compliance in any compliance yearthat begins less than three years after the date the REC is created. Theexception to this is when RECs that are held by the Delaware SustainableEnergy Utility (SEU), which is required to act as a REC aggregator forcustomer-sited renewable energy facilities. The three-year REC lifetime is""tolled"", or suspended, during any period in which a REC is held by the SEU.This provision was added by S.B. 173 in July 2009 and revised rulesincorporating the change were adopted in December 2009 by the PSC.  **Compliance:**  Suppliers must submit report an annual report detailing their compliancestatus. Suppliers who fail to comply with the standard's requirements must payinto the Delaware Green Energy Fund an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of$25 per MWh of shortfall. The solar ACP (SACP) is $150 per MWh.    **Credit multipliers:**Several compliance multipliers are currently available under the Delaware RPS.The details of these multipliers are described below:  * 300% credit toward RPS compliance for in-state customer-sited photovoltaic generation and fuel cells using renewable fuels that are installed on or before December 31, 2014. The 300% multiplier cannot be applied to SRECs used for compliance with the PV carve-out, thus for PV carve-out compliance purposes, SRECs are counted on a 1-to-1 basis. The 300% credit formerly applied to all solar electric generation prior to the 2007 amendments.  * 150% credit toward RPS compliance for energy generated by wind turbines sited in Delaware on or before December 31, 2012. This provision dates to the 2005 legislation that established the RPS.  * 350% credit for PSC-regulated electric companies (i.e., Delmarva Power & Light, the state's only investor-owned utility) for energy derived from offshore wind facilities sited on or before May 31, 2017. This provision was added by S.B. 328 in 2008.  * An additional 10% credit (i.e., 110% credit) for solar or wind installations sited in Delaware for which at least 50% of the equipment or components are manufactured in Delaware.

Separately, in February 2010 Governor Markell issuedExecutive Order No. 18, which sets a variety of energy conservation goals andrequirements intended to make the state a leader by example in clean energyand sustainability.    Under Executive Order No. 18, executive branch state agencies and departmentswere required to reduce energy consumption by 30% by the end of Fiscal Year(FY) 2015 when compared to FY 2008, with interim targets of 10% by the end ofFY 2011 and 20% by the end of FY 2013. The requirement applies to coveredentities that occupy either state-owned or state-leased buildings. The orderfurther prescribes a series of energy conservation practices for stateemployees to follow, such as turning off lights when they are not in use,eliminating the use of portable appliances, following green computingpractices, and setting appropriate thermostat settings in different types offacilities.    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Departmentof Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), is required to developa system for benchmarking, monitoring and tracking energy use and carbonemissions in state-owned and state-leased facilities. The system shouldultimately be used to prioritize energy efficiency and distributed renewableenergy projects based on energy savings, cost savings and environmentalbenefits. On-site wind, photovoltaics, and combined heat and power arespecifically identified as measures that should be evaluated forimplementation, provided that they have a simple payback of 20 years or less.This directive is coupled with a renewable electricity procurement target of20% by FY 2012 and 30% by FY 2013 for executive branch state agencies,offices, and departments.    The order also dictates that new construction and major renovation projectsshould be designed to meet or exceed the USGBC LEED Silver rating standards,and that third-party certification must be pursued for such projects if it canbe accomplished at a reasonable cost. Additional sections of the order addressrecycling, clean transportation, and environmentally sensitive procurementpractices for state government.    Through Delaware’s official partnership with ENERGY STAR, signed February 27,2004, the state offers purchasing and procurement training for schools andgovernment agencies.

While many jurisdictionshave adopted green building standards for public buildings, DC is among thefirst to make such requirements for privately-owned buildings. Subsequentlegislation (the Healthy Schools Act of 2010) expanded provisions of theoriginal law related to public schools and privately-owned educationalfacilities.    The new standards are phased in over the course of several years withpublicly-owned buildings being the first required to comply. All newconstruction and substantial improvements of non-residential District owned orDistrict instrumentality owned projects which were initially funded in FiscalYear 2008 or later must achieve LEED NC 2.2 or LEED CS 2.0 certification atthe Silver level. Public Schools also are required to meet the requirements ofLEED for Schools at the Certified level, or the equivalent under another greenbuilding rating system. To the extent that funding for construction orrenovation is available public schools are required to meet LEED for SchoolsGold level certification. And all public housing projects with 10,000 squarefeet of gross floor area or greater, will be required to fulfill or exceed theGreen Communities 2006 standard or another equivalent standard.    Starting January 1, 2009, all new construction or major renovations to non-residential, private buildings of 50,000 square feet or more must submit agreen building checklist outlining green features that will be pursued. Newconstruction and major renovations to non-residential privately ownedbuildings started after January 1, 2012 will need to be verified as havingfulfilled or exceeded the LEED NC, LEED CS, or LEED for Schools standard atthe Certified level.

2594,Oregon,OR,Renewable Portfolio Standard,"As part of the Oregon Renewable Energy Act of 2007 (SB 838), the state ofOregon established a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) for electric utilitiesand retail electricity suppliers. This RPS was updated by SB 1547* in 2016 toraise the target to 50% renewable energy by 2040. Different RPS targets applydepending on a utility's size. Electricity service suppliers must meet therequirements applicable to the electric utilities that serve the territoriesin which the electricity service supplier sells electricity to retailconsumers.**Requirements**  Large investor-owned utilities -- those with 3% or more of the state's load --must ensure that a percentage of the electricity sold to retail customers in-state be derived from eligible renewable energy resources according to thefollowing schedule:    * 5% by 2011    * 15% by 2015    * 20% by 2020    * 27% by 2025    * 35% by 2030    * 45% by 2035    * 50% by 2040Smaller utilities are subject to lower standards. Utilities with less than1.5% of state load must meet a 5% RPS by 2025. Utilities with more than 1.5%,but less than 3% of state load must meet a 10% RPS by 2025. However, utilitiesthat buy into a new coal plant or sign a new contract specifically for newcoal power and publicly-owned utilities that annex investor-owned utilityterritory without consent (aside from municipal utilities under certainconditions) are subject to the “large utility” standards. Utilities with lessthan 3% of state load as of 2007 that subsequently serve over 3% of retailload in three consecutive years must meet a 25% RPS within 20 years. Largeconsumer-owned utilities must also meet a 25% target for 2025 and subsequentcalendar years.**Eligible Technologies  ** Eligible renewable resources include electricity generated from solar,wind, hydropower, ocean thermal, wave, and tidal power, geothermal, hydrogenderived from certain renewable sources, municipal solid waste, and biomass,including biogas. SB 1547 also made eligible the thermal energy for asecondary purpose produced by facilities that generate electricity frombiomass. Only 11 MW of municipal solid waste can count towards the RPS eachyear. Incineration facilities using chemically-treated wood are not eligible.Eligible resources must be located within Western Electricity CoordinatingCouncil (WECC) territory or must be designated environmentally preferable bythe Bonneville Power Administration (BPA).To qualify as an eligible renewable resource, electricity must be generated bya hydroelectric facility that becomes operational on or after January 1, 1995.Electricity from facilities operational before January 1, 1995 attributable toefficiency upgrades, or, for non-hydropower facilities, capacity upgradescompleted on or after January 1, 1995, is a qualifying resource. A limitedamount of hydropower from facilities operational before 1995 can qualify as aneligible resource under certain conditions. 50 average MW of utility-owned,pre-1995, low-impact hydropower can be used for compliance; 40 average MW ofnon-utility owned, pre-1995, low-impact hydropower can be used for compliance.HB 3674 (2010) allowed pre-1995 biomass and municipal solid waste facilitiesto be eligible for RPS compliance. Additionally, with the passage of HB 2622(2011), electricity generated by facilities that burn coal as a fuel source,but stop burning coal completely and convert to renewable energy after January1, 2012, can be used to comply with the RPS.A matrix detailing eligible resources, targets by utility size, and affectedutilities is available on the program website listed above.**Compliance**  RPS compliance must be demonstrated through the purchase of renewable energycredits (RECs) through the Western Renewable Energy Generation InformationSystem (WREGIS). RECs may be either bundled with, or purchased separatelyfrom, electricity contracts. RECs must come from a facility located within theWestern Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). Unbundled RECs can meet only20% of a large utility's compliance obligation and 50% of a large consumer-owned utility's obligation until 2020. After 2020, large consumer-ownedutilities can use up to 20% unbundled RECs to meet their complianceobligations.** A consumer owned utility that transitions from the small tolarge utility category may use up to 100% unbundled RECs to comply when itscompliance requirement is 5%; 75% unbundled RECs when its compliancerequirement is 15% and 20%; and 20% unbundled RECs when its compliancerequirement is 25%. Most RECs associated with renewable energy that comesonline by 2022 may be banked and carried forward for complianceindefinitely.*** RECs associated with renewable energy sources that becomeoperational in 2023 or later may be banked or carried forward for five years.RECs cannot be counted toward compliance with both Oregon's RPS and an RPS ofanother state or use in voluntary “green power” programs. However, RECs can becounted toward both Oregon's RPS and a federal RPS should one be enacted.In order to reflect changes made by Senate Bill 1547 (2016), the OregonDepartment of Energy's Rulemaking in 2017 amended the requirements forstranded thermal generation, updated the language on allowable REC vintages,and required that electricity service suppliers (ESSes) and distributionutilities must mutually agree upon a delivery point for generation eligible toproduce bundled RECs.**Carve-Outs and Credit Mulitipliers**  SB 1547 also established a requirement that by 2025 at least 8% of Oregon'saggregate electrical capacity come from small-scale, community renewableenergy projects with a capacity of 20 megawatts (MW) or less. Communityrenewable energy projects may include small scale renewable energy projects aswell as combined heat and power facilities using biomass. This requirementexisted as a goal under the previous legislation. SB 339 (2017) allowed up to20 MW from combined heat and power facilities using biomass to meet the 8%community-based renewable energy projects requirement described above.The RPS also includes a multiplier for small solar. PV systems with a capacityof 500 kW to 5 MW installed within Oregon prior to January 1, 2016 will becredited for two kilowatt-hours (kWh) for each kWh generated, with respect toRPS compliance.**Cost Mitigation Measures**  There are two mechanisms that serve as cost protections for Oregon consumers-- an alternative compliance payment (ACP) mechanism and an overarching “costcap” on utility RPS expenditures. In lieu of procuring renewable resources,utilities can pay an ACP to be placed in a holding account to be spent onenergy conservation programs or procuring eligible resources. The OregonPublic Utilities Commission (PUC) established the 2014-2015 ACP rate as $110per megawatt-hour (MWh) for Portland General Electric, Pacific Power, andelectric service providers. The governing body will establish an ACP rate forconsumer-owned utilities. Electric utilities are not required to fully complywith a renewable portfolio standard during a compliance year to the extentthat compliance costs exceed 4% of the utility's annual revenue requirementfor the compliance year.    Utilities are also exempt from RPS compliance requirements if the purchase ofelectricity from eligible sources would:    * exceed a utility's projected load requirements;    * require the utility to substitute eligible renewable electricity for sources other than coal, natural gas or petroleum;    * require the utility to substitute eligible renewable electricity from existing large hydropower located on the Columbia River; or    * reduce a consumer-owned utility's purchase of the lowest price electricity from the BPA.Investor-owned utilities are allowed to recover all of their prudently-incurred costs, including above-market costs, associated with RPS compliancein electricity rates.    Investor-owned utilities and electricity service suppliers must submit acompliance report annually to the PUC. Consumer-owned utilities must submitthe report to the members or customers of the utility. The PUC can imposepenalties against investor-owned utilities or suppliers that fail to complywith the RPS in an amount the PUC determines -- in addition to any alternativecompliance payment. Payments will be transmitted to the Oregon Energy Trust tosupport renewable energy and energy efficiency programs.    In addition, the PUC has authority by statute to temporarily suspend autility’s RPS obligations if meeting those obligations would threatenreliability standards established by North American Reliability Corporation.  _* The 2016 legislation also requires Oregon’s large utilities to phase outcoal generation imports by 2035, as well as to pursue all cost-effectiveenergy efficiency and demand-response measures and to propose programs fortransportation electrification. It establishes a community solar program andorders the PUC to craft rules for participation._** _There is no limit to unbundled RECs associated with facilities located inOregon that are net metered, not directly connected to a distribution ortransmission system, or qualifying facilities under the Public UtilityRegulatory Policies Act._*** _Certain RECs may only be banked and carried forward for five years. Thoseare RECs associated with qualifying renewable energy that came online on orbefore the effective date of SB 1547 or between 2016 and 2022 under a contractof less than 20 years; or RECs issued more than five years after a qualifyingenergy source becomes operational_",Renewables Portfolio Standard,Regulatory Policy,1,http://www.oregon.gov/energy/energy-oregon/Pages/Renewable-Portfolio-Standard.aspx,NA,NA

For more detailed information aboutbuilding energy codes, visit theDOE and BCAP websites.**_    The Connecticut Office of the State Building Inspector establishes andenforces building, electrical, mechanical, plumbing and energy coderequirements by reviewing, developing, adopting and administering the statebuilding code. Compliance is determined through construction documentssubmitted to the relevant local building official showing detailed buildingdata and features, and equipment systems governed under the code. Variancesand interpretations of the code are granted through the Connecticut Departmentof Public Safety.    HB 7432, enacted in June 2007, added provisions to strengthen the state'sbuilding code, and required the state building inspector and the Codes andStandards Committee to revise the state building code by January 1, 2008. Thenew code applies to all buildings (including residential buildings) and isdesigned to provide optimum cost-effective energy efficiency over the usefullife of the building. HB 6284 of 2009 further required the state buildinginspector and the Codes and Standards Committee to adopt the 2012 version ofthe IECC within 18 months of its publication.    HB 7432 also created a requirement for certain building projects (notincluding residential buildings with less than four units) to follow approvedgreen building guidelines. The provision applies to buildings constructedafter January 1, 2009, that are projected to cost at least $5 million, andbuilding renovation projects started after January 1, 2010, that are projectedto cost at least $2 million. The bill required building projects which meetthis criteria to achieve a silver rating from LEED, a two-globe rating in theGreen Globes USA design program, or an equivalent standard. After enforcementdifficulties for this provision were identified, HB 6284 of 2009 revised therequirement so that the affected buildings do not have to be certified underthese green building programs, but must simply be designed to adhere to theirspecifications. The state building inspector and the Codes and StandardsCommittee will adopt provisions within the state building code specific tothese building types that reference these green building certificationprograms, but allow building owners to demonstrate compliance through meansother than certification under those specific certification programs.Public Act 15-194 effective October 1st 2015 requires each municipality toincorporate residential solar photovoltaic systems on its building permitapplication process. Residential solar PV systems for the purpose are definedas systems sized up to 12 kW or less and are installed on the roof of asingle-family home. By January 2016, each municipality is required to includea permit application on their website, and allow electric submission of theapplication.

In June 2008, the state enacted additionallegislation, H.B. 4766, requiring state agencies and public school districtsto develop energy conservation plans towards an ultimate goal of a 20%reduction in energy use by 2020, as compared to 2000 levels.In May 2013 the Sustainable Construction Advisory Committee responsible foradopting buildings codes was mandated to automatically adopt the most recentversion of the rating systems developed by the Green Building Initiative andthe U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and EnviornmentalDesign.    **Sustainable Building Construction**  All major facility projects in the state must be designed, constructed, andreceive at least two globes using the Green Globes Rating System or receivethe LEED Silver standard. All major facility projects in the state must beanalyzed using a life-cycle cost analysis comparing the cost and benefits ofdesigning, constructing, maintaining and operating the facility at the LEEDSilver standard or two globes standard, or better, with certification; normalindustry and regulatory standards as applicable; or some standard between thetwo that causes the project to be designed and constructed in a manner thatachieves the lowest thirty-year life cycle cost. The State Engineer's Officemay waive requirements for a proposed major facility project if it isdetermined that the costs of meeting the requirement are not economicallyfeasible.    The program does not apply to the following types of projects:    * a building, regardless of size, that does not have conditioned space as defined by Standard 90.1 of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE);      * a public kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, secondary school, junior high school, or high school;      * a correctional facility constructed for the South Carolina Department of Corrections, Department of Mental Health, or Department of Juvenile Justice;      * a building project funded by the South Carolina Ports Authority, the Coordinating Council for Economic Development, or the South Carolina Infrastructure Bank; or      * a building project funded by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control in which the primary purpose of the building project is for the storage of archived documents.**Energy Use Reduction Goals**  Under H.B. 4766, all state agencies and public school districts are requiredto submit energy conservation plans to the State Energy Office for allbuildings in use as of July 1, 2008. The goal of the plans should be to reduceenergy use by 1% annually for five years beginning July 1, 2008. The law alsosets an ultimate goal of reducing energy use 20% by July 1, 2020, relative to2000 levels. Agencies and districts are required to implement all energysaving improvements that are cost-effective over a five-year time horizon.The energy reduction goals do not apply to buildings designed, constructed andmaintained under the Sustainable Construction Act of 2007 (see above).

In 2012, S.B. 1533 amended therequirement to allow the use of any green energy technology (includinggeothermal electric, geothermal direct use, solar electric, solar thermal, andpassive solar) to meet the requirement. The law requires public agencies tospend at least 1.5% of the total contract price of an eligible public buildingon green energy technologies. SB 3169 of 2013 allows green energy technologieslocated away from the site of a public building to satisfy the requirement ifcertain qualifications are met. Eligible buildings include any permanentstructure owned, partially owned, or controlled by a public if any of thefollowing is true:    * The building is used by the public;    * The building allows employees use or occupy the building on a regular basis for a significant part of their work.Only public buildings where the total contract price is $1,000,000 or more fora single building or a group of buildings on the same site, or contracts formajor renovations that exceed $1,000,000 and 50% of the insured value of thebuilding are included in the requirement. Geothermal systems, passive solarthermal systems, or daylighting systems must reduce the building's baselineenergy use by 20% or more in order to be eligible for the standard. Solarelectric, solar water heating, solar pool heating, and active solar spaceheating systems must be installed in locations that have a total solarresource fraction of 75% or more. Geothermal and solar electric systems mustbe metered separately to record electricity production.Before entering into a public improvement contract, a contracting agency mustprepare a written determination of whether a green energy technology system isappropriate for the building. The State Department of Energy developed astandard form for contracting agencies to use in developing theirdetermination. If the contracting agency determines that green energytechnology is inappropriate for a particular project, they can refrain frominstalling such systems, but must spend 1.5% of the project cost to installgreen energy technology on a future building project.

2916,Iowa,IA,Ames Electric Department - Net Metering,"In March 2008 the Ames City Council approved a resolution adoptinginterconnection procedures and a net metering tariff rider for renewableelectricity generators smaller than 10 kW.* The tariff and procedures applyequally to all classes of Ames Electric Department customers. Renewable energyis defined to include technologies that rely exclusively on wind, solar,biomass, biomass waste products, landfill gas, hydroelectric, geothermal,wave, and tidal power. It does not include technologies that rely on fossilfuels, fossil fuel waste products, or waste products from inorganic sources.The use of the word ""exclusively"" in the definition would apparentlydisqualify mixed resource systems (e.g., coal-biomass co-firing). Under theterms of the interconnection agreement, systems must be in compliance with allapplicable provisions of the National Electric Code (NEC); UL Standards 1741and 1703; IEEE 929; and all local building codes. The rules also containadditional technical requirements, including the installation of a utilityaccessible external, lockable disconnect switch. The utility may have arepresentatives present at the initial system test, and may perform additionaltests at its own expense within 20 days of the receipt of a Certificate ofCompletion from the customer-generator. The witnessing provision is waivedafter 20 days. Any renewable energy credits (RECs) or other environmentalattributes produced by customer-sited systems accrue to the utility. Meteringis accomplished using a single bi-directional meter at the customer's originalplace of metering to measure net electricity consumption. Net excessgeneration (NEG) as calculated for any billing month may be carried over tosubsequent months as a credit at the customer's retail rate. Credits may onlybe banked for 12 months, at which time they are granted to the utility. Theminimum enrollment term under the net metering rider is one year, extendedautomatically unless terminated by either party with 60 days written notice.The customer is responsible for all permitting and interconnection costsassociated with system installation and operation. _*Iowa was one of the firststates in the country to adopt statewide net metering rules (1984), but thestatewide rules apply only to investor-owned utilities (IOUs).

3233,Nevada,NV,Renewable Energy Sales and Use Tax Abatement,"New or expanded businesses in Nevada may apply to the Director of the StateOffice of Energy for a sales and use tax abatement for qualifying renewableenergy technologies. The purchaser is only required to pay sales and use taxesimposed in Nevada at the rate of 2.6%. The abatement is valid for three yearsbeginning with the approval of the application.    The abatement applies to property used to generate electricity from renewableenergy resources including solar, wind, biomass*, fuel cells, geothermal orhydro. Generation facilities must have a capacity of at least 10 megawatts(MW). Facilities that use solar energy to generate at least 25,840,000 Britishthermal units of process heat per hour can also qualify for an abatement.    There are several job creation and job quality requirements that must be metin order for a project to receive an abatement. Depending on the population ofthe county or city where the project will be located, the project owners must:    * Employ a certain number of full-time employees during construction, a percentage of whom must be Nevada residents    * Ensure that the hourly wage paid to the facility's employees and construction workers is a certain percentage higher than the average statewide hourly wage    * Make a capital investment of a specified amount in the state of Nevada    * Provide the construction workers with health insurance, which includes coverage for the worker's dependentsAB 239 (2013) provided additional criteria for considering projects eligible.Note that this exemption does not apply to residential property, or propertythat is owned, operated, leased or controlled by a governmental entity.  _**History**_  This abatement went through significant revisions with AB 522, signed in May2009. Notably, AB 522 raised the capacity minimum for eligible projects from10 kilowatts (kW) to 10 MW. It also changed the abatement such that thepurchaser is only required to pay sales and use taxes imposed in Nevada at therate of 2.6 % (effective through June 30, 2011) and at the rate of 2.25 %(effective July 01, 2011 - June 30, 2049), extended it to additionaltechnologies, and increased the qualification requirements to ensure thatincentivized projects result in more high quality jobs. These changes tookeffect on July 1, 2009. AB 522 also created a property tax abatement forrenewable energy producers. In 2013, SB 475, a broad tax extender bill,extended the 2.6% tax rate through 2015, and in 2015, SB 483 extended the 2.6%rate indefinitely.    * _Biomass is defined as any organic matter that is available on a renewable basis, including, without limitation, agricultural crops and agricultural wastes and residues; wood and wood wastes and residues; animal wastes; municipal wastes; and aquatic plants._",Sales Tax Incentive,Financial Incentive,1,http://energy.nv.gov/Programs/Renewable_Energy_Tax_Abatements/,7/1/2009,2009

The Model Ordinance describesenergy projects and siting issues and includes model ordinance language andcommentary. Energy projects below certain thresholds are not regulated by theOregon Energy Facility Siting Council, so the model ordinance can serve as abasis for local regulation of these energy projects. The model languageprovides a conceptual framework that local governments can adapt to suit localcircumstances and to address local energy resources.    The model ordinance not only includes general standards for all energyprojects, but also details specific standards for different technologies.Specific standards for wind address visual impact, wildlife resources, publicsafety, and setbacks. The model ordinance is intended to apply to commercialwind projects; residential or agricultural projects under 50 kilowatts (kW) insize are exempt. Specific standards for solar address acreage, groundleveling, wildlife resources, misdirection of solar radiation, public safety,airport proximity, and cleaning chemicals and solvents. The model ordinance isintended to apply to large-scale solar electric projects that generateelectricity for structures located off-site. It should be noted that thespecific setback and clearance distances in the model ordinance are meant tobe suggestions only; they illustrate the concept, but are not formalrecommendations or standards.

Theprohibition includes restrictions put in place by county and localgovernments; homeowner's associations; and organizations formed for themanagement of commonly owned properties. The provisions apply only to windenergy systems that qualify for support under the state Green Energy Fund --which offers incentives for residential wind energy systems -- or similarprograms administered by Delaware's State Energy Office.    The law also defines a limited set of reasonable restrictions that governmentsand associations are permitted to use in regulating residential wind energysystems. Any limitations put in place may not be more restrictive than thefollowing:    * Setbacks: 1.0 times the height of the turbine (base to tip of a blade) from property lines.    * Noise: No more than 5 decibels above average existing noise level up to a maximum of 60 decibels at any location along the property line.    * Appearance: Systems must be free from signage, advertising, streamers and other decorative items not related to their operation. Electrical wiring of non-building integrated systems must be placed underground.The originally adopted law declared all such restrictions enacted after theeffective date (30 days after enactment) to be void and unenforceable; thus,it did not affect existing restrictions or those put in place before August 8,2009. However, in July 2010 the code was amended (H.B. 500, Section 88) todeclare that existing county or municipal zoning prohibitions or restrictionsthat are not consistent with the wind access provisions described above are nolonger in effect, and that qualifying wind energy systems do not require aconditional use or other zoning review process.

3564,Oregon,OR,Solar Volumetric Incentive and Payments Program,"**_NOTE: This incentive program is no longer taking new applications._**In June 2009, Oregon established a pilot solar volumetric incentive rate andpayment program.* Under this incentive program, systems of up to 500 kilowatts(kW) are paid for the kilowatt-hours (kWh) generated over a 15 year period, ata rate set at the time a system is initially enrolled in the program. ThePublic Utilities Commission (PUC) established rates and rules in May 2010.This program must be offered by the three investor-owned utilities in Oregonand will be administered by the utilities, though the PUC will periodicallyre-evaluate rates. The program costs are recoverable in utility rates andutility-owned systems are not allowed to receive the incentive.In May 2013, the program cap was increased from 25 megawatts (MW) to 27.5 MW,and the deadline for the program was extended to March 31, 2016. The original25 MW aggregate program cap was divided by utility based on 2008 retail salesrevenue, with specific sub-allocations for small, medium, and large scalesystems. Portland General Electric (PGE) had a total allocation of 14.9 MW,Pacific Power had 9.8 MW, and Idaho Power had 0.4 MW (limited to residentialsystems under 10 kW). The additional 2.5 MW capacity added in 2013 has beenallocated as follows:    * PGE: 1,433 kW (860 small/573 medium)    * Pacific Power: 1,012 kW (607 small/405 medium)    * Idaho Power: 55 kW (all small)Rates differ by system size and geographic zone, and are re-evaluated forevery enrollment window. Small- and medium-scale systems participate in aprogram that is modeled after net metering, where customers are paid for theamount of utility electric load consumption that is offset by on-site solarphotovoltaic generation. The incentive paid to the customer is the volumetricincentive rate minus the retail rate. Participating PV systems must be sizedno larger than 90 percent of historical energy usage for a home or business,must be grid-connected, metered, and meet all applicable codes andregulations. Systems must be ""permanently installed"" and must remain inservice for the entire useful life.  After the 15 year contract ends, systemsmay continue to be paid for electricity generation, with the rate based on the""resource value."" As defined by the legislation, the resource value isdetermined by the avoided cost of energy and the avoided cost of transmissionand distribution.Systems receiving the incentive payment may have reduced eligibility for someother state incentives. Systems may either take the incentive payment or thestate tax credit and Energy Trust rebate; systems are not eligible for theincentive payment and the tax credit and rebate. Enrollment in the pilotprogram will be closed when the 27.5 MW cap is reached, or on March 31, 2016,whichever is earlier.**Small Systems**The original program did not specify a minimum size for eligible systems, butHB 2893 specifically refers to systems with a nameplate capacity between fiveand 100 kW; therefore, all projects receiving incentives in 2014 and latermust be greater than 5 kW. While initially program capacity for small andmedium system was allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, it is nowdone by lottery for small systems.Current Volumetric Incentive Rates for Small Systems (5-10 kw) are as follows:Zone  |  Counties |  Electric Companies |  Incentive Rates as of 05/01/2015**  ---|---|---|---  1 |  Benton, Clackamas, Clatsop, Columbia, Lane, Linn, Marion, Multnomah,Polk, Tillamook, Washington and Yamhill |  Pacific Power and PGE |  $0.351/kWh  2 |  Coos, Douglas and Hood River |  Pacific Power and PGE |  $0.227/kWh  3 |  Gilliam, Jackson, Josephine, Klamath, Morrow, Sherman, Umatilla, Wallowaand Wasco |  Pacific Power |  $0.227/kWh  4 |  Baker, Crook, Deschutes, Jefferson, Lake, Malheur and Harney |  PacificPower and Idaho Power |  $0.207/kWh    **Medium Systems**Medium sized systems are between 10 and 100 kW in nameplate capacity. Theprocess for setting the incentive amounts for medium sized systems alternatesbetween competitive bids and a lottery with rates set by the PUC. Rates forthe May 2015 enrollment window will be set by competitive bid, with bids dueby May 1.**Large Systems**Systems sized larger than 100 kW can participate in the competitive biddingportion of this program. Utilities issue a request for proposals once peryear. At that time, systems can put in a bid to participate and winning bidswill be selected based solely on price factors. The actual rate paid will bedetermined by bids received and will be set at the time of enrollment.Prior to the April 2014 enrollment window, the remaining capacity allocatedfor large systems was too small to generate large projects, so the PUC addedthis capacity allocation to the medium size class. The most recent winningbids for large systems were just under $0.11/kWh.  _*While certain legislative bills referenced the development of a ""solar feed-in tariff"", the rules and rates for this program were to be determined by thePUC. Due to concerns regarding FERC jurisdiction and the ability of the stateto set rates for the feed-in tariff, the current pilot program differs from atypical ""feed-in tariff"".    **The actual rate paid to small-scale systems will be the volumetric incentiverate listed minus the retail rate, as these systems are participating in thenet metering option and are being paid for offsetting consumption. _",Performance-Based Incentive,Financial Incentive,0,http://www.puc.state.or.us/Pages/solar/index.aspx,7/1/2010,2010

4111,Delaware,DE,Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) Spot Market Program,"**_A Delaware SREC Pilot Procurement Program was approved in November of 2011by the Delaware Public Service Commission. The details of the pilot programcan be found_** **_here._**In 2005, Senate Bill 74 established a renewables portfolio standard (RPS)requiring Delaware retail electricity suppliers to purchase 10% of theelectricity sold in the state from renewable sources by 2019. Senate Bill 19of 2007 increased the RPS target to 20%, and added a requirement that aportion of the requirement be met with solar photovoltaic (PV) resources. Thestandard was expanded again to 25% renewables and 3.5% photovoltaics by 2026by S.S. 1 for S.B. 119 enacted in July 2010. The PV target began at 0.011% forthe June 2008 - May 2009 compliance year (CY 2009) and accelerates slowly overtime towards an ultimate target of 3.5% for compliance year 2025-2026. The RPSapplies to the state's investor-owned utilities, retail electricity suppliers,municipal utilities, and rural electric cooperatives. Municipal utilities andrural electric cooperatives are allowed to opt out of the RPS requirements ifthey establish a comparable RPS program for their own ratepayers by 2013, andestablish a green energy fund.    Under Delaware law, a solar renewable energy credit (SREC), is equivalent toone megawatt-hour (MWh) of retail electricity sales in the state that isderived from a qualifying PV resource. Electricity suppliers must purchaseSRECs in order to meet their compliance obligations under the law, or pay aSolar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) for any shortfalls in SRECpurchases. The SACP operates as a ceiling on the price that a supplier wouldpay for SRECs used for compliance with the Delaware RPS. In general, the SACPis initially set at $400 per MWh, but increases to $450 per MWh if theelectricity supplier has opted for the ACP in any previous year, and thenincreases to $500 for subsequent years. The Delaware Energy Office has theauthority to review and adjust the ACP and SACP given certain marketconditions. As of October 2014, sales of Delaware-sourced SRECs tracked on theSRECTrade averaged $55 per MWh.    Under this system SRECs represent a potentially significant source of revenuefor owners of qualifying PV facilities with a value determined by demand inthe trading market. In Delaware, net metering customers retain ownership ofSRECs (or RECs) for energy produced and consumed by the customer. A generatorremains eligible to generate SRECs for as long as the facility remainscertified as an eligible generator. SRECs submitted for compliance with theRPS must have been created no more than three years prior to the year in whichthey are used for compliance. In other words, an SREC may generally be usedfor compliance by an obligated electricity supplier for the compliance yearduring which it was generated or the two subsequent compliance years.* Anobligated entity may use an SREC to comply with the PV carve-out of the RPS orwith the general renewables requirement. For the purposes of compliance, anSREC generated by a customer-sited facility physically located within Delawareand installed on or before December 31, 2014 is granted a 300% multiplier ifused to fulfill the general renewables requirement. Thus, one SREC equals oneSREC for the PV carve-out, but three RECs used to fulfill the generalrenewables requirement.*    In order to begin producing Delaware-eligible SRECs, generators must becertified by the Delaware Public Service Commission (PSC) as an eligiblegenerator. In order to qualify as an eligible generator, customer-sitedfacilities (i.e., behind the meter facilities) must be physically locatedwithin the state of Delaware. Generation from other facilities qualifies forDelaware's standard if the generator is located within the PJM footprint, orif the electricity is imported into the PJM and tracked through the PJM MarketSettlement System. When the generator has been issued a certification number,they may create an account with the PJM-EIS Generation Attribute TrackingSystem (GATS). The GATS is used to track the generation and transfer of SRECsfrom an eligible facility. SRECs are created in the GATS based on energyproduction meter readings uploaded to the system by the generator. Unlike someother states, Delaware does not allow small generators to use engineeringestimates of energy production as the basis for creating SRECs.  The passage of S. B. 124 in July of 2011 amended the Delaware RPS to allowenergy output from a Qualified Fuel Cell Provider Project in fulfilling aportion of the requirements under the RPS Act. A qualified fuel cell providerproject is a fuel cell power generation project located in Delaware ownedand/or operated by a Qualified Fuel Cell Provider. A qualified provider isdefined in S.B. 124 as a commercial operation which manufactures fuel cellscapable of being run on renewable fuels and is designated as an economicdevelopment opportunity by the Delaware Economic Development Office and theDNREC. The energy produced by such projects shall fulfill the commission-regulated electric company's state-mandated REC and SREC requirements. Thefulfillment of the equivalent of 1 REC is equal to each MWh of energy. Theseprojects will fulfill no more than 30% of the SREC requirements at a ratio of6 MWh of RECs per 1MWh of SRECs.    _* The Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility (SEU) is required to act as a RECaggregator for customer-sited renewable energy facilities. The three-year REClifetime is ""tolled"", or suspended, during any period in which a REC is heldby the SEU.    ** Delaware also has allows a small credit bonus of 10% for solar electricityproduced by solar (or wind) installations for which at least 50% of theequipment (on the basis of cost) is manufactured in Delaware, or for which 75%of the labor and construction is performed by an in-state workforce._",Performance-Based Incentive,Financial Incentive,0,http://depsc.delaware.gov/electric/delrps.shtml,06/01/2008 (beginning of the first solar carve-out compliance year),NA

Reasonable costs of any energy audit may be included in the amountof the loan upon request by the applicant. In receiving a loan, theparticipant agrees to pay a special assessment on the property, collected inthe same manner as real property taxes, for the purpose of repaying the loan.The special assessment constitutes a lien on the property senior to all otherliens except real property taxes, with similar penalties for non-payment.During the application process the applicant must certify that such anassessment does not violate any existing lender agreements.    A special assessment being collected as a result of an energy efficiency loanmay remain attached to the property upon its sale. The seller of the propertyis required to inform the buyer of the existence of the assessment; however,failure of disclosure does not relieve the buyer of the obligation to pay theassessment. For rental dwellings, participant property owners which pass onthe cost of the assessment (i.e., the cost of energy efficiency improvements)to tenants are also required to pass on the value of the energy savings.** Properties applying for PACE financing :**      * must be located within the District of Columbia      * must not be in default, or have a history of default, on mortgage or property payments      * cannot have a combined debt limit of 90% of current value (including PACE financing)      * must have primary mortgage holders give written consent to take a secondary position to PACE loan in cases of default.  The program will provide financing for projects costing between $250,000 and$10,000,000; larger and smaller projects will be considered on a case-by-casebasis. The term of the repayment is up to 20 years. The Mayor is permitted toauthorize the issuance of up to $250 million in bonds to fund the program. TheNational Capital Energy Fund has been created to serve as the destination ofbond proceeds, as well as other federal funding such as Energy EfficiencyConservation Block Grants (EECGBs), which may become available to support theprogram. As of October 1, 2021, the DC PACE program has transitioned to the DCGreen Bank.**History**In April 2010 the District of Columbia City Council enacted legislationproviding for the creation of a PACE energy efficiency financing programwithin the District for residential, commercial, industrial, and other realproperty. The authorizing legislation describes a wide variety of energyefficiency improvement projects eligible under the program, such asinsulation, building envelope improvements, HVAC system upgrades, andlighting. The law also permits PACE loans to be used to finance renewableenergy projects (details not specified), as well as any other “modification,installation, retrofit, or remodeling approved as an electric or gas utilitycost-savings measure”. **Eligible Property Types:**      * Non-profit and special Use      * Industrial      * Institutional      * Multifamily      * Commercial office/retail **Eligible Project Types:**      * Soft costs      * Storm water retention      * Water conservation      * Lighting and controls      * HVAC systems      * Envelope improvements      * Renewables and generation",PACE Financing,Financial Incentive,1,https://dcpace.com/building-owners/,NA,NA

4421,Connecticut,CT,CCEF - ARRA Commercial Solar PV Program,"**Program Update:  This program is fully subscribed as of May 2011. Theinformation provided below is for reference only, no additional funding isavailable. **The Connecticut Clean Energy Fund launched the Commercial Solar Photovoltaic(PV) program in October 2010 using funding from the American Recovery andReinvestment Act (ARRA).* This program is available to commercial, industrial,non-profit organizations, municipal, state, local, and federal entities for PVinstallations. There is no set amount for the grant, rather the amount isintended to help projects ""break even"" and ""make a reasonable return"" whencompared to what the customer would have paid their utility for power.    Solar PV projects must be at least 50 kilowatts (kW) in size but no more than200 kW and must be designed for on-site use. Projects must use commerciallyavailable PV technology, be relatively far along in the permitting process,have (or be close to having) site control, be ready for installation. Projectsrequiring minimal investment from CCEF will be selected over those thatrequire more significant investments. In addition, an energy audit is requiredfor the site of the proposed PV project (or evidence that an energy audit wascompleted on the site at least within 3 years prior to submitting theapplication) and all recommendations made within the audit that have paybackperiods of five years or less must have been implemented. As an alternative tothe energy audit, sites that have previously participated in CEEF funded,utility-run energy efficiency programs may be eligible. Projects with third-party power purchase agreements are eligible. There are additional ARRA-related requirements (i.e. historical preservation review, requirements thatprevailing wages be paid, as well as certain ""buy American"" provisions if thesite is a public building).      * _In the past, commercial PV was incentivized through the On-site Distributed Generation Program. However, funding for PV for that program had been exhausted between June 2010 and November 2010, the program was not accepting applications from commercial entities.

4476,District of Columbia,DC,Solar Renewable Energy Credits,"In January 2005, the District of Columbia (D.C.) Council enacted a RenewablePortfolio Standard (RPS) with a solar carve-out that applies to all retailelectricity sales in the District. In October 2008 the RPS was amended by theClean and Affordable Energy Act (CAEA) of 2008. Significantly, thislegislation increased the percentage and number of benchmarks that utilitiesmust meet, included solar water heating as an eligible technology, increasedthe alternative compliance payment and amended reporting requirements. Thesolar requirements began in 2007 at 0.005% of retail electricity sales andincrease annually towards an ultimate target of 2.50% solar by 2023. Notably,both solar-electric and solar thermal resources are eligible for the solarcarve-out.  Under D.C. law, a solar renewable energy credit (SREC), is equivalent to onemegawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity derived from an eligible solar resource.Electricity suppliers must purchase SRECs in order to meet their complianceobligations under the law, or pay a Solar Alternative Compliance Payment(SACP) for any shortfalls in SREC purchases. The SACP operates as a ceiling onthe price that a supplier would pay for SRECs used for compliance with theD.C. RPS. The SACP is set at a flat rate of $500 per MWh. The value of an SRECvaries based on market conditions, but as of September 2014 sales ofD.C.-sourced SRECs tracked on Flett Exchange averaged $471 per MWh. Individualtrades have taken place at both lower and higher prices and it should be notedthat these prices reflect SRECs generated in D.C. which may have been soldinto other state SREC markets.    Under this system SRECs represent a potentially significant source of revenuefor owners of qualifying solar facilities with a value determined by demand inthe trading market. In D.C., net metering customers retain ownership of SRECs(or RECs) unless they agree to transfer them. A generator remains eligible togenerate SRECs for as long as the facility remains certified as an eligiblegenerator. SRECs have a three-year lifetime from the date they are created. Inother words, an SREC may generally be used (i.e., retired) for compliance byan obligated electricity supplier for up to three years after the date it iscreated. An obligated entity may use an SREC to comply with the solar carve-out of the RPS or with the general renewables requirement. As of September2014, total of 1,174 solar PV, 74 solar thermal system inside D.C. and 2,239solar energy systems outside of D.C. were eligible to meet the city's RPSrequirement. In order to begin producing D.C.-eligible SRECs, generators mustbe certified by the D.C. Public Service Commission (PSC) as an eligiblegenerator. In order to qualify as an eligible generator, solar facilities mustbe located within the District of Columbia or in locations served by adistribution feeder serving the District of Columbia.SRECs generated by solar energy facilities that were certified by the PSCprior to February 1, 2011, are excluded from this requirement and are allowedto be used to meet the RPS solar requirement.*    When the generator has been issued a certification number, they may create anaccount with the PJM GATS. The PJM GATS is used to track the generation andtransfer of SRECs from an eligible facility. SRECs are created in the GATSbased on energy production meter readings uploaded to the system by thegenerator. Solar PV facilities of 10 kilowatts (kW) or less and solar thermalfacilities which produce or displace less than 10,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) peryear are permitted to use an engineering estimate to generate SRECs rathermetered generation data. Solar thermal systems or collectors must be certifiedby the SRCC in order to qualify for the standard.**  BackgroundAmendments made in 2010 by D.C. Law 18-0223 have clarified the eligibility ofsolar thermal facilities located within the District, and geographiceligibility of renewable (including solar) resources in general. Furtheramendments were made by D.C. Law 18-0303 in March 2011 to clarify thecertification requirements for non-residential solar thermal systems.  InAugust of 2011, the RPS was further amended by both the Emergency DistributedGeneration Amendment Act  of 2011 (B19-0384), and the Distributed GenerationAmendment Act (B19-10), which increased the solar carve out from 0.4% to 2.50%by 2023. Following a Congressional Review Period, The Distributed GenerationAmendment Act became D.C. Law 19-36 on October 20, 2011. The changes resultingfrom before mentioned legislation are reflected in the D.C. Code § 34-1432.    _* Prior to D.C. Law 19-36, eligible generator solar facilities were allowedto be located within the PJM  Interconnection region or a state adjacent tothe PJM Interconnections region. This portion of the law was amended by D.C.Law 18-0223 in July 2010 to remove confusing language pertaining to RECsassociated with electricity delivered into the PJM Interconnection region froman adjacent control area. These terms are defined in greater detail in therules adopted by the PSC._    __** This portion of the law was amended on a by D.C. Law 18-0303 in March2011 to revise language associated with certification requirements for non-residential solar thermal systems. The prior wording of the law required allnon-residential solar thermal systems to be SRCC certified without making adistinction between the collectors (i.e., SRCC OG-100) and the system (i.e.,SRCC OG-300). The revised language makes this distinction, clearing the wayfor non-residential systems to be certified as eligible for the standard.  __",Performance-Based Incentive,Financial Incentive,0,http://www.dcpsc.org/electric/renewable.asp,01/01/2006 (date of REC creation initially allowed),NA

The Draft Decision approves the use of a full revenuedecoupling mechanism identical to the one in place for the United IlluminatingCompany, Connecticut's other major investor-owned electric distributionutility. The decision is subject to final approval by PURA later in December2014, but the requirements of Public Act 13-298 ensure that CL&P will operateunder such a mechanism upon final approval.**_**Origin**Established in 1998 and subsequently revised several times, Connecticut'srenewables portfolio standard (RPS) requires each electric supplier and eachelectric distribution company wholesale supplier to obtain at least 23% of itsretail load by using renewable energy by January 1, 2020. Specific to energyefficiency, the RPS creates a ""carve-out"" that requires each electric supplierand each electric distribution company wholesale supplier to obtain at least4% of its retail load by using combined heat and power (CHP) systems andenergy efficiency by 2010.**Electric Demand and Energy Reduction Standard**Within the renewable portfolio standard, separate portfolio standards arerequired for energy resources classified as ""Class I,"" ""Class II,"" or ""ClassIII."" Class III resources eligible for the energy efficiency carve-outinclude: (1) customer-sited CHP systems, with a minimum operating efficiencyof 50%, installed at commercial or industrial facilities in Connecticut on orafter January 1, 2006; (2) electricity savings from conservation and loadmanagement programs that started on or after January 1, 2006, provided that onor after January 1, 2014, no such programs supported by ratepayers shall beeligible; and (3) systems that recover waste heat or pressure from commercialand industrial processes installed on or after April 1, 2007. The revenue fromthese credits must be divided between the customer and the state Conservationand Load Management Fund, depending on when the Class III systems areinstalled, whether the owner is residential or nonresidential, and whether theresources received state support.    Electric providers must meet the standard with at least 4% Class III sourcesby 2010, and thereafter, according to the following schedule:Year |  Percentage of Retail Load Covered by Class III RECs  ---|---  2007 |  1%  2008 |  2%  2009 |  3%  2010 and Thereafter |  4%    According to a 2014 PURA decision regarding 2011 compliance (the most recentinformation available), all utilities or retail providers that must meet the4% requirement had either met it in 2011 or paid an alternative compliancepayment for each REC it chose not to earn from energy efficiency programs.**Program Administrator Type**Energy efficiency and demand-side management programs that provide compliancewith the standard are managed by Connecticut's electric utilities. TheConnecticut Energy Efficiency Board, appointed by the Connecticut PublicUtility Regulatory Authority (PURA) oversees the Connecticut Energy EfficiencyFund, which provides funding for the utilities and other providers' programs.**Cost-Effectiveness and Program Evaluation**To evaluate the cost effectiveness of its efficiency and demand reductionactivities, Connecticut law specifies the use of the Utility Cost Test (UCT),which is one of the five ""California tests"" from the California StandardPractice Manual as its primary test for measuring the cost-effectiveness ofenergy efficiency programs. Connecticut also uses the Total Resource Cost test(TRC).**Utility Cost Recovery Provisions**Pursuant to Public Act 13-298, Connecticut's investor-owned electric and gasutilities must submit plans in their next rate cases to decouple theirrevenues from their sales.

4507,Rhode Island,RI,Energy Efficiency Resource Standard,"**Origin**Rhode Island enacted legislation in 2006 requiring the state Public UtilitiesCommission (PUC) to establish standards for system reliability, energyefficiency and conservation procurement, including standards for energy supplydiversification, distributed generation, demand response, and ""prudent andreliable"" energy efficiency and energy conservation measures.Additional legislation enacted in June 2012 (H.B. 8233) requires utilities tosupport the installation of efficient combined heat and power (CHP) systems atcommercial, industrial, institutional and municipal facilities. Each utilitymust specify in its annual efficiency program plan how it will do so. Proposedplans must be approved by the state's Energy Efficiency and ResourceManagement Council.     **Electric Sales and Demand Reduction (and Natural Gas Sales Reduction)**The specific standards and guidelines pursuant to legislation must be reviewedat least once every three years. In late 2014, the PUC adopted the followingrequired triennial targets for its rate-regulated electric and gas utilitiesfor the period 2015-2017.Year | Electric Energy Savings  (Relative to 2012 Baseline)| Gas Savings  (Relative to 2012 Baseline)  ---|---|---  2015 | 2.50% (193,603 MWh) | 1.00% (376,915 MMBTU)  2016 | 2.55% (197,475 MWh) | 1.05% (395,760 MMBTU)  2017 | 2.60% (201,347 MWh) | 1.1% (414,606 MMBTU)    The triennial plan also requires peak summer and winter demand reductions inthe following amounts:  Year | Summer Peak Demand Reduction (  | Winter Peak Demand Reduction    ---|---|---  2015 | 27,268 kW (27.3 MW) | 27,268 kW (27.3 MW)  2016 | 27,813 kW (27.8 MW) | 27,268 kW (27.3 MW)  2017 | 27,268 kW (27.3 MW) | 27,268 kW (27.3 MW)    Each electric and natural gas distribution company must submit to the PUC forreview and approval every three years -- beginning September 1, 2008, andending September 1, 2017 -- a plan for system reliability, energy efficiencyand energy conservation procurement. **Program Administrator Type**While the recommended standards and programs intended to meet the standard areinitially vetted through the Rhode Island Energy Efficiency and ResourceManagement Council (EERMC), the seats of which are comprised of arepresentative range of energy efficiency stakeholders, the programs areadministered by Rhode Island's affected utilities. **Cost Effectiveness and Program Evaluation**Rhode Island uses the Total Resource Cost test (TRC), one of the five""California tests"" in the California Standard Practice Manual, as the primarytest for evaluating the programs intended to meet the standard.**Utility Cost Recovery Provisions** _Decoupling and Program Cost Recovery_    Rhode Island Statute 39-2.1.2 requires each electric distribution company toinclude a surcharge per kilowatt-hour delivered to fund demand-side managementprograms, which are implemented by the electric distribution company. Theelectricity surcharge took effect January 1, 2008, and will remain in placethrough December 31, 2017. Similarly, each gas distribution company mustinclude a surcharge per decatherm (Dth) delivered to fund demand-sidemanagement programs. The gas surcharge took effect January 1, 2007, and willremain in place through December 31, 2017. The PUC determines the surchargelevels, which are not specified by the statute, for electricity and gasdelivery.The Narragansett Electric Company (d/b/a National Grid), Rhode Island'slargest electric and gas utility, has its electric and gas revenues decoupledfrom its sales._Performance Incentive for Narragansett Electric Company (d/b/a NationalGrid)_In addition, National Grid receives performance incentives for achievement(and exceedance) of its electric and gas efficiency targets. The utility canearn incentives starting at 75% savings target achievement, and can be earnedon a sliding scale basis up to 125% for both gas and electric programs. Forannual program achievement levels ranging from 75% to 100% of target, the(relatively complex) formulas used to determine National Grid's incentive canbe stated as: _Incentive = Total Program Spending * (15% x (The level of achieved savings)- 10%)_For annual program achievement levels from >100% and 125%, the formula can bestated as: _Incentive = Total Program Spending * (5% x (The level of achieved savings))_While natural gas savings are strictly measured on an energy (MMBTU) basis andnot on demand reduction, the incentive is strictly a function of energysavings. However, electric incentives have separate electric energy and demandsavings and demand savings components. The energy and demand components are70% and 30% of the total electric incentive, respectively.  Given the complexity of the formula (and two-part nature of the electricportion), the first table below illustrate the maximum possible after-taxincentives for specific levels of electric efficiency target achievements,from 75% to 125%, strictly on a percentage basis.Utility Type | Max After-Tax Electric Incentive  | Max After-Tax Gas Incentive    ---|---|---  75% (Min) | 1.25% | 1.25%  80% | 2% | 2%  85% | 2.75% | 2.75%  90% | 3.50% | 3.50%  95% | 4.25% | 4.25%  100% | 5% | 5%  105% | 5.25% | 5.25%  110% | 5.50% | 5.50%  115% | 5.75% | 5.75%  120% | 6% | 6%  125% (Max) | 6.25% | 6.25%      This table shows the combined after-tax incentive totals for National Grid'selectric and gas utilities, also on a percentage basis.

4510,Delaware,DE,Energy Efficiency Resource Standards,"**_Note: In August of 2013, Delaware enacted SB 150, legislation requiringDelaware 's Sustainable Energy Utility to develop, measure, evaluate andpromote cost-effective programs. The law now requires the Delaware PublicService Commission (PSC) to establish rules to oversee the SEU's programs.However, the law was written to say that this requirement to pursue cost-effective programs is ""notwithstanding the energy savings targets"" that couldbe construed as an energy efficiency resource standard. In addition, theDelaware Public Service Commission has not yet established rules to implementthe new law._**In July 2009 the Delaware legislature enacted legislation creating energysavings targets for Delaware's investor-owned, municipal, and cooperativeelectric utilities, as well the state's natural gas distribution companies.These targets are hereafter referred to collectively as the Delaware EnergyEfficiency Resource Standard or EERS. The law requires affected electricutilities to establish programs which save the equivalent of 15% of 2007electricity consumption and peak electric demand by 2015. The standard alsoincludes an interim reduction target of 2% of electricity consumption and peakdemand by 2011. Affected natural gas utilities are required to save theequivalent of 10% of 2007 natural gas consumption by 2015, with an interimtarget of 1% by 2011.    Energy efficiency is defined to include energy savings resulting from measuresor programs that target customer behavior; replace or improve the efficiencyof equipment, processes, or devices; or result in reductions in transmissionand distribution losses associated with the design and operation of theelectric system. Combined heat and power systems and the use of ""recycledenergy"" may also count as sources of energy savings.    The legislation required the Delaware Department of Natural Resources andEnvironmental Control (DNREC) to develop regulations implementing the standardby July 29, 2010 (one year after the enactment); however, as of this writingfinal regulations have not been promulgated. The EERS Workgroup created by thelaw has completed a report examining the feasibility and impact of thestandard and providing implementation recommendations in June of 2011.    Utilities are permitted to determine the best way to achieve the energysavings targets and to develop and fund programs towards this end.

Utilities that are not rate-regulated (municipal andcooperative utilities) were required to establish their own energy efficiencygoals. In 2019, Iowa also enacted S.F. 638, which disallows utilities fromadopting energy efficiency plans that result in projected cumulative averageannual costs that exceed 1.5% and 2% of gas and electric utilities' respectiveannual retail rate revenue from retail customers. These goals were filed inDecember 2009.

One such requirement was that they contribute tothe existing Green Energy Fund for investor-owned utilities or create theirown green energy fund supported by an equal surcharge (i.e. $0.000178/kWh).All of Delaware's municipal utilities opted out of the RPS requirements andestablished their own green energy funds.    In 2010 the Delaware RPS was amended by SS 1 for S.B. 119 and the section (26Del. C. § 363) detailing the obligations of electric cooperatives was slightlyrevised.

5120,Connecticut,CT,Residential Solar Investment Program,"In March 2012, the Connecticut Green Bank* unveiled the Residential SolarInvestment Program (RSIP) with a goal to support 30 megawatts of residentialsolar photovoltaics (PV) by 2022 through Public Act 11-80. The original goalwas met in June 2014. In June 2015, Public Act 15-194 expanded the Program tosupport up to 300 MW of new residential solar PV by 2022. The 300 MW is aneffective cap of the total solar PV that the program can support. The programis set to expire on 2022, or when new solar PV installations reach totalcapacity of 300MW.  This residential program is limited to 1-4 family owner-occupied primaryresidences. Only customers of Eversource (formerly Connecticut Light & Power)and United Illuminating are eligible. There are two incentive types available,depending on the ownership of the PV system.**Expected Performance-Based Buydown (EPBB)** : Expected Performance BasedBuy-Down incentives (EPBB or Rebate) are only available to Homeowners choosingto purchase a PV system from an Eligible Contractor. The Eligible Contractormust present the EPBB as an upfront cost reduction to the customer. The GreenBank will issue the EPBB payment directly to the Eligible Contractor on behalfof the homeowner at completion of the installation and upon Green Bankverification of submitted completion documents. **Performance Based Incentive** : Performance Based Incentives (PBI) are onlyavailable to System Owners under a third-party financing structure (i.e. leaseor power purchase agreement (PPA)). Under the PBI, homeowners will contractwith Eligible Contractors and/or Third Party System Owners to provide a solarPV system. The PBI is paid to the System Owner over twenty-four (24) calendarquarters following a passing Green Bank inspection and is based on actualproduction at a per-kilowatt-hour rate specified at the time of RSIPproject/incentive approval. System Owners are expected to build the expectedtotal PBI into the lease or PPA rate to the customer.EPBB and PBI payments cannot be combined for a single project under the RSIPand no homeowner purchasing a PV system will be allowed to claim a PBI orreceive a PBI. Likewise, no system owner offering third-party financing willbe allowed to claim or receive an EPBB for the same project.Customers are required to have a home energy audit and must work with acontractor from the Green Bank's Eligible Contractor list. The contractor isresponsible for completing all the paperwork and application materials, whichare all completed online.  **Solar Home Residential Energy Credits (SHRECs)**Funding for the expansion of the Program to include 300 MW of solar PV isderived through the sale of Solar Home Renewable Energy Credits (SHRECs).SHRECs represent the environmental attributes of one megawatt-hour ofelectricity generated through residential solar PV systems that are installedthrough the RSIP on or after January 1st, 2015.SHRECs created by the residential solar system that participate in the RSIPwill automatically be transferred to the Green Bank. SHRECs will have a termlife of two years, including its year of production and the following year.The Green Bank will sell SHRECs to the electric distribution companies (EDCs)through master purchase agreements as 15-year annual tranches. UnitedIlluminating will be required to purchase 20% of the annual aggregate credits,and 80% of of the credits must be purchased by Eversource. The price of theSHRECs will be determined by the Green Bank, which shall not exceed the priceof small ZRECs, or will be set five dollars less than the State’s AlternativeCompliance Payment (ACP). The EDCs may retire the SHRECs for their compliancewith the Class I portion of their Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)requirement, or resell the credits.

5321,Connecticut,CT,Local Option - Commercial PACE Financing,"** _NOTE: In 2010, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which hasauthority over mortgage underwriters Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, directedthese enterprises against purchasing mortgages of homes with a PACE lien dueto its senior status above a mortgage. Most residential PACE activity subsidedfollowing this directive; however, some residential PACE programs areoperating with loan loss reserve funds, appropriate disclosures, contractualsubordination or other protections meant to address FHFA's concerns. TheFederal Housing Administration (FHA), a branch of the U.S. Department ofHousing and Urban Development (HUD), has released initial guidelines for usingPACE with FHA-secured single or multifamily properties. This guidance isindependent of FHFA policy. Commercial PACE programs were not directlyaffected by FHFA’s actions, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not underwritecommercial mortgages. Visit PACENation for more information about PACEfinancing, and for a comprehensive list of all PACE programs across thecountry._**On June 2012, Connecticut passed legislation enabling Commercial PropertyAssessed Clean Energy financing (C-PACE), targeting commercial, industrial andmultifamily property owners. C-PACE is a financial policy tool that allowsproperty owners to finance qualifying energy efficiency and clean energyimprovements on their properties through a special assessment on the propertytax bill, which is repaid over a period of years (up to 20 years).Connecticut's C-PACE program is “owner-arranged,” meaning the property ownercontracts directly with a private capital provider to obtain financing. Thespecial assessment (also called a lien) on the property shall take precedenceover all other liens except a lien for taxes of the municipality on realproperty. The lien automatically transfers to the next owner in the event of asale or transfer of ownership. The lien is senior to a mortgage, although itis non-accelerated, meaning in the event of default, only the payments inarrears would come due.To participate in C-PACE financing, interested property owners must:      * Be located in a participating municipality. C-PACE maintains a list of participating municipalities. Interested property owners should contact CEFIA if their municipality is not on the list of participating municipalities.      * Work with an approved energy professional (such as an auditor or contractor) to identify eligible projects. CT Green Bank will maintain a list of approved contractors. In general, improvements must be permanently affixed to the property and should either lower the building’s energy consumption or produce clean energy.      * Apply for financing via CT Green Bank's C-PACE web site. If approved, CT Green Bank will place a lien on the property and financing will become available. Property owners repay the financing via the local property tax bills over the course of 20 years.      * Obtain written consent of existing mortgage holders.While there is no financing minimum, PACE financing is best suited for capitalimprovements above $150,000, due to transaction costs.

All incentives are retroactiveto January 1, 2015.In June of 2014 S.B. 1189 mandated the creation of a voluntary DistributedEnergy Resource Program and mandated that the Public Service Commissiondevelop new accompanying net metering rules. The legislation allowsparticipating utilities to recover costs connected to meeting a 2021 target of2% aggregate generation capacity from renewable energy sources. Facilitiessized between 1 MW and 10 MW will make up 1% of aggregate generation (50% ofthe total target) while facilities sized under 1 MW will make up another 1%(another 50% of the total target). Twenty five percent of facilities under 1MW must also be under 20 kW (12.5% of the total target). Renewable energyresources include solar PV, solar thermal, wind, hydroelectric, geothermalresources, wave and tidal resources, recycling resources, hydrogen fuelderived from renewable resources, combined heat and power derived fromrenewable resources, and biomass resources.Once a participating utility satisfies the minimum 2% requirement, the utilitymay invest in renewable energy facilities between 1 MW and 10 MW with acumulative installed capacity equal to one percent of the utility's previous 5year retail peak demand average.Voluntary distributed energy resource programs have been adopted by DukeEnergy Progress, South Carolina Gas & Electric, and Duke Energy Carolina.Program descriptions and incentive are available in May 12th settlementagreements in Docket 2015-53-E (Duke Energy Progress), Docket 2015-54-E (SC G& E) Docket 2015-55-E (Duke Energy Carolinas)S.B. 1189 mandates that the Public Service Commission (PSC) creates a programto offer nonprofits easier access to renewable energy and to incentivizeresidential customers to become customer-generators by purchasing or leasingrenewable generation equipment. The PSC is empowered to determine theappropriate cost recovery for the utility by determining avoided andincremental costs, but must limit annual cost recovery costs to $12 forresidential customers, $120 for commercial customers, and $1,200 forindustrial customers.The PSC will submit report to the General Assembly about the DistributedEnergy Resource Program and net metering to the general assembly no later thanJuly 31st 2016\. The program will expire on January 1, 2021, but cost recoverywill be in effect until all costs are recovered.Emerging program details will be recorded in PSC Docket 2014-246 E. **History**On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005(EPAct). Section 1251 of the EPAct required, inter alia, that each electricutility shall make available upon request net metering service to any electricconsumer that the electric utility serves. The Commission was given two yearsfrom the date of enactment (due by August 8, 2007) to initiate a proceeding toconsider this and other requirements of the Act. In December, 2005 the Officeof Regulatory Staff petitioned the Commission to initiate such a proceeding,and a proceeding was commenced. After receiving 10 Petitions to Intervene andnumerous comments submitted by the public, the Commission held a hearing inMay 2007, resulting in Order No. 2007-618 .The Order accepted the jointproposal of the parties, with two exceptions. The proposal was to implementthe same Net Energy Metering program in place in North Carolina at the time,which effectively required Net Energy Metering customers to be on a Time-of-Use (TOU) Rate. In no case would the charge to the customer be less than zero,and the credits generated above use would carry forward until being zeroed outin a year cycle. Residential customers would be limited to 20kW and non-residential to 100kW installations up to an aggregate maximum of .2% of SouthCarolina peak load. Under this proposal the Renewable Energy Credits would begranted to the utility. The first exception to the joint proposal required bythe Commission is that customers should have the option to be on a flat raterather than variable rate tariff. Consequently, the Commission required theutilities to propose tariffs that would allow consumers wishing to net meterthe opportunity to do so without being on a TOU Rate or detail reasons whysuch a tariff would be infeasible. The second exception to the joint proposalwas the Commission observation that while the Renewable Energy Credits werenot then being traded, such credits might be traded in the future, at whichtime the Commission will revisit ownership interests in the Renewable EnergyCredits.Additional subsequent hearings were held February 2008 and May 2008. Afterextensive public input, the Commission issued Order No. 2008-416 directing theutilities to 1) make net metering plans available to their customers no laterthan July 1, 2008; 2) to have trained and knowledgeable customer servicepersonnel available to assist customers by July 1, 2008; 3) make explanationsof their net metering programs available on their websites. Commission staffwas instructed to schedule another hearing to review these programs inapproximately one year.In June 2009, the Commission held the above-mentioned review hearing resultingin Order No. 2009-552. A comprehensive Settlement Agreement was filed,satisfying all parties to the proceeding. The Settlement Agreement stipulatedthat the regulated utilities must: 1) standardize the net metering programstructure for uniformity among the three companies; 2) modify the flat rateoption for residential customers to reflect 1:1 standard retail rate forexcess energy credits; 3) eliminate standby charges for residential customers;4) allow ownership of Renewable Energy Credits to be retained by the generatoruntil a market is established, then annually grant credits associated withexcess generation to the utilities; and 5) report annually the number of netmetering customers by energy type. The parties also agreed that the netmetering process should be reviewed within four years.In 2013, a workshop to review Net Metering in South Carolina was scheduled bythe Commission, but later deferred pending legislative action by the SouthCarolina General Assembly. The resulting legislation is the Distributed EnergyResource Program Act (Senate Bill No. 1189).",Renewables Portfolio Standard,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA

5686,District of Columbia,DC,Solar Renewable Energy Credits,"In January 2005, the District of Columbia (D.C.) Council enacted a RenewablePortfolio Standard (RPS) with a solar carve-out that applies to all retailelectricity sales in the District. In October 2008 the RPS was amended by theClean and Affordable Energy Act (CAEA) of 2008. Significantly, thislegislation increased the percentage and number of benchmarks that utilitiesmust meet, included solar water heating as an eligible technology, increasedthe alternative compliance payment and amended reporting requirements. Thesolar requirements began in 2007 at 0.005% of retail electricity sales andincrease annually towards an ultimate target of 2.50% solar by 2023. Notably,both solar-electric and solar thermal resources are eligible for the solarcarve-out.Under D.C. law, a solar renewable energy credit (SREC), is equivalent to onemegawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity derived from an eligible solar resource.Electricity suppliers must purchase SRECs in order to meet their complianceobligations under the law, or pay a Solar Alternative Compliance Payment(SACP) for any shortfalls in SREC purchases. The SACP operates as a ceiling onthe price that a supplier would pay for SRECs used for compliance with theD.C. RPS. The SACP is set at a flat rate of $500 per MWh for 2016 -2023, $400per MWh for 2024 - 2028, $300 per MWh for 2029 - 2041, and $100 per MWh for2042 and thereafter. The value of an SREC varies based on market conditions.  In D.C., net metering customers retain ownership of SRECs (or RECs) unlessthey agree to transfer them. A generator remains eligible to generate SRECsfor as long as the facility remains certified as an eligible generator. SRECshave a three-year lifetime from the date they are created. In other words, anSREC may generally be used (i.e., retired) for compliance by an obligatedelectricity supplier for up to three years after the date it is created. Anobligated entity may use an SREC to comply with the solar carve-out of the RPSor with the general renewables requirement. As of September 2014, total of1,174 solar PV, 74 solar thermal system inside D.C. and 2,239 solar energysystems outside of D.C. were eligible to meet the city’s RPS requirement. Inorder to begin producing D.C.-eligible SRECs, generators must be certified bythe D.C. Public Service Commission (PSC) as an eligible generator. In order toqualify as an eligible generator, solar facilities must be located within theDistrict of Columbia or in locations served by a distribution feeder servingthe District of Columbia.  SRECs generated by solar energy facilities that were certified by the PSCprior to February 1, 2011, are excluded from this requirement and are allowedto be used to meet the RPS solar requirement.*  When the generator has been issued a certification number, they may create anaccount with the PJM GATS. The PJM GATS is used to track the generation andtransfer of SRECs from an eligible facility. SRECs are created in the GATSbased on energy production meter readings uploaded to the system by thegenerator. Solar PV facilities of 10 kilowatts (kW) or less and solar thermalfacilities which produce or displace less than 10,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) peryear are permitted to use an engineering estimate to generate SRECs rathermetered generation data. SRECs are awarded to Solar Thermal based on their kWhsavings at the ratio 3,412 BTUs = 1kWh. Solar thermal systems or collectorsmust be certified by the SRCC in order to qualify for the standard.**   _ Background_Amendments made in 2010 by D.C. Law 18-0223 have clarified the eligibility ofsolar thermal facilities located within the District, and geographiceligibility of renewable (including solar) resources in general. Furtheramendments were made by D.C. Law 18-0303 in March 2011 to clarify thecertification requirements for non-residential solar thermal systems. InAugust of 2011, the RPS was further amended by both the Emergency DistributedGeneration Amendment Act of 2011 (B19-0384), and the Distributed GenerationAmendment Act (B19-10), which increased the solar carve out from 0.4% to 2.50%by 2023. Following a Congressional Review Period, The Distributed GenerationAmendment Act became D.C. Law 19-36 on October 20, 2011. The changes resultingfrom before mentioned legislation are reflected in the D.C. Code § 34-1432.   _* Prior to D.C. Law 19-36, eligible generator solar facilities were allowedto be located within the PJM Interconnection region or a state adjacent to thePJM Interconnections region. This portion of the law was amended by D.C. Law18-0223 in July 2010 to remove confusing language pertaining to RECsassociated with electricity delivered into the PJM Interconnection region froman adjacent control area. These terms are defined in greater detail in therules adopted by the PSC._   _** This portion of the law was amended on a by D.C. Law 18-0303 in March2011 to revise language associated with certification requirements for non-residential solar thermal systems. The prior wording of the law required allnon-residential solar thermal systems to be SRCC certified without making adistinction between the collectors (i.e., SRCC OG-100) and the system (i.e.,SRCC OG-300). The revised language makes this distinction, clearing the wayfor non-residential systems to be certified as eligible for the standard._",Solar Renewable Energy Credit Program,Financial Incentive,1,https://dcpsc.org/Utility-Information/Electric/RPS.aspx,NA,2005
5689,Delaware,DE,Sustainable Electric Utility (SEU)- SREC Purchase Program,"**Note: The competitive solicitation process for 2022 ended on October 14th at5:00pm. Check the website for more details on future solicitations.    Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SREC) Delaware**    In Delaware, the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requires electricitysuppliers to secure a portion of their electricity from solar generators. TheSREC program provides a means for Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) to becreated for every 1000 kilowatt watt-hours of solar electricity created.    The SREC is sold separately from the electricity and represents the “solar”aspect of the electricity that was produced. The value of an SREC isdetermined by the market subject to supply and demand constraints. SRECs canbe sold to electricity suppliers needing to meet their solar RPS requirement.     **Annual SREC Procurement Program**    In 2011, the Delaware legislature amended the solar portion of the stateRenewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to switch the burden of acquiring SRECsaway from the power providers to the electric distribution companies inDelaware. This amendment drastically reduced the number of buyer participants,effectively making Delmarva Power, the largest electric distribution utilityin Delaware, the de-facto long term buyer for the majority of the DE SRECrequirement. In response, Delmarva Power proposed the implementation of anSREC procurement program, called the Annual SREC Procurement Program thatprovides 20 year contracts to SREC sellers on a competitive basis.    Delmarva, which has selected the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility tooperate the program, plans to run at least one solicitation each spring inorder to fulfill its long-term SREC needs. The solicitation is run as an on-line auction. Facilities that qualify as having been built with eitherDelaware labor or Delaware manufactured parts may be granted an SREC bonus of10% for each qualification. For example, a facility that qualifies as havingbeen built with Delaware labor may be granted the equivalent of 10% SREC bonusfor every SREC produced.

TheRPS applies to the state's investor-owned utilities, retail electricitysuppliers, municipal utilities, and rural electric cooperatives. Municipalutilities and rural electric cooperatives are allowed to opt out of the RPSrequirements if they establish a comparable RPS program for their ownratepayers by 2013, and establish a green energy fund.  Under Delaware law, a solar renewable energy credit (SREC), is equivalent toone megawatt-hour (MWh) of retail electricity sales in the state that isderived from a qualifying PV resource. Electricity suppliers must purchaseSRECs in order to meet their compliance obligations under the law, or pay aSolar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) for any shortfalls in SRECpurchases. The SACP operates as a ceiling on the price that a supplier wouldpay for SRECs used for compliance with the Delaware RPS. In general, the SACPis initially set at $400 per MWh, but increases to $450 per MWh if theelectricity supplier has opted for the ACP in any previous year, and thenincreases to $500 for subsequent years. The Delaware Energy Office has theauthority to review and adjust the ACP and SACP given certain marketconditions. As of October 2014, sales of Delaware-sourced SRECs tracked on theSRECTrade averaged $55 per MWh.    Under this system SRECs represent a potentially significant source of revenuefor owners of qualifying PV facilities with a value determined by demand inthe trading market. In Delaware, net metering customers retain ownership ofSRECs (or RECs) for energy produced and consumed by the customer. A generatorremains eligible to generate SRECs for as long as the facility remainscertified as an eligible generator. SRECs submitted for compliance with theRPS must have been created no more than three years prior to the year in whichthey are used for compliance. In other words, an SREC may generally be usedfor compliance by an obligated electricity supplier for the compliance yearduring which it was generated or the two subsequent compliance years.* Anobligated entity may use an SREC to comply with the PV carve-out of the RPS orwith the general renewables requirement. For the purposes of compliance, anSREC generated by a customer-sited facility physically located within Delawareand installed on or before December 31, 2014 is granted a 300% multiplier ifused to fulfill the general renewables requirement. Thus, one SREC equals oneSREC for the PV carve-out, but three RECs used to fulfill the generalrenewables requirement.*    In order to begin producing Delaware-eligible SRECs, generators must becertified by the Delaware Public Service Commission (PSC) as an eligiblegenerator. In order to qualify as an eligible generator, customer-sitedfacilities (i.e., behind the meter facilities) must be physically locatedwithin the state of Delaware. Generation from other facilities qualifies forDelaware's standard if the generator is located within the PJM footprint, orif the electricity is imported into the PJM and tracked through the PJM MarketSettlement System. When the generator has been issued a certification number,they may create an account with the PJM-EIS Generation Attribute TrackingSystem (GATS). The GATS is used to track the generation and transfer of SRECsfrom an eligible facility. SRECs are created in the GATS based on energyproduction meter readings uploaded to the system by the generator. Unlike someother states, Delaware does not allow small generators to use engineeringestimates of energy production as the basis for creating SRECs.  The passage of S. B. 124 in July of 2011 amended the Delaware RPS to allowenergy output from a Qualified Fuel Cell Provider Project in fulfilling aportion of the requirements under the RPS Act. A qualified fuel cell providerproject is a fuel cell power generation project located in Delaware ownedand/or operated by a Qualified Fuel Cell Provider. A qualified provider isdefined in S.B. 124 as a commercial operation which manufactures fuel cellscapable of being run on renewable fuels and is designated as an economicdevelopment opportunity by the Delaware Economic Development Office and theDNREC. The energy produced by such projects shall fulfill the commission-regulated electric company's state-mandated REC and SREC requirements. Thefulfillment of the equivalent of 1 REC is equal to each MWh of energy. Theseprojects will fulfill no more than 30% of the SREC requirements at a ratio of6 MWh of RECs per 1MWh of SRECs.    _* The Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility (SEU) is required to act as a RECaggregator for customer-sited renewable energy facilities. The three-year REClifetime is ""tolled"", or suspended, during any period in which a REC is heldby the SEU.    ** Delaware also has allows a small credit bonus of 10% for solar electricityproduced by solar (or wind) installations for which at least 50% of theequipment (on the basis of cost) is manufactured in Delaware, or for which 75%of the labor and construction is performed by an in-state workforce._",Solar Renewable Energy Credit Program,Financial Incentive,1,http://depsc.delaware.gov/delrps.shtml,beginning of the first solar carve-out compliance year,2008

The overall weightedaverage for the solicitation was $32.75 per SREC._**Delaware Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) Procurement Program isdesigned to assist in the creation of a market for SRECs and to provide amechanism for the procurement of SRECs to ensure that retail electricitysuppliers meet the requirements set forth in Delaware's Renewable EnergyPortfolio Standards Act (REPSA).The program utilizes a public solicitation for SRECs for different tiers ofsolar generators based on capacity. The Sustainable Energy Utility (SEU),contracted with InClime, will administer all aspects of the bid process foreach utility that decides to participate. Delmarva Power is the onlyparticipating utility at this time; therefore, the estimates for procurementare based Delmarva Power’s projected need for SRECs in compliance year.      * New systems are defined as having a final interconnection approval after the closing date of the preceding auction process (i.e. May 24th, 2014 for the 2015 auction). Existing systems are defined as having a final interconnection approval date before the closing date of the preceding auction process (May 24th, 2014 for the 2015 auction).**Project Eligibility**Project must be certified in DE to create SRECs and can be in the serviceterritory of any utility in DE. SRECs created in previous energy years are noteligible for the auction. Proposed projects are required to begin operatingwithin one year of the award date. Projects that certified using Delawareparts and labor qualify for additional 10% bonus for each category.**Program Tiers**Solicitation is divided into different tiers based on size and interconnectiondate.

All applicants must submit fixed dollar amount bidsfor the first 10 years, after which from a standard price of $35 per SREC willbe paid out for next 10 years. Contract terms are non-negotiable.    **History**In September 2011, Delmarva Power & Light filed an application with theDelaware Public Service Commission to seek approval of a pilot program for theprocurement of SRECs. Through this application, Delmarva sought approval toimplement a pilot program calling for the SEU to acquire, through an openprocurement process, the SRECs needed for Delmarva Power to purchase itsminimum number of SRECs for compliance year 2011 as set forth in state's RPS.Delmarva submitted a compliance filing for the State of Delaware Pilot Programfor the Procurement of Solar Renewable Energy Credits in February 2012, asrequired by PSC Order No. 8093.The 2012 pilot program created a multi-tiered solicitation for long-term SRECsthat included multiple system sizes and customer classes under 20 year SRECpurchase contracts. Standard offer contracts were awarded to systems less than250 kW for years 1-10, with a rate of $50 per SREC for years 11-20. Systems251 kW to 2 MW were subject to competitive bid pricing for years 1-10, with arate of $50 per SREC for years 11-20. In April 2012, the SEU, contracting withSRECTrade, opened the first round of solicitations and awarded contracts to166 solar PV systems totaling an estimated 7.7 MW of capacity.

22445,Rhode Island,RI,Community Remote Net Metering Program,"In 2016, H.B. 8354 expanded Rhode Island's net metering rules to includecommunity solar. Rhode Island's Renewable Energy Fund has provided communityrenewable incentives before community solar was officially enshrined.    The community net metered system can be owned by one of the participatingcustomers, or be financed by a third party through lease arrangements orpower/credit purchase agreements. The total amount of community net meteringis capped at 30 MW until the end of 2018, after which the PUC may decide toexpand or modify the aggregate amount after administrative process. OnDecember 2016, the PUC determined that the public housing authorities areconsidered public entities and are not subject to the 30 MW cap in thecommunity net metering program. Municipal Collaborative facilities,educational institutions, federal government, hospitals, and non-profits arealso exempt from this cap. Active enabling legislation is required to expandthe program past the 30 MW cap; the cap was met in 2019.",Community Solar Rules,Regulatory Policy,1,https://energy.ri.gov/renewable-energy/solar/community-solar,NA,NA

22451,Connecticut,CT,Non-Residential Renewable Energy Solutions,"** _NOTE: In May 2018,S.B. 9 signed into law and made significant changes tothe state's Renewable Portfolio Standard and Net Metering policies. The lawends net metering to new customers when the Virtual Net Metering, Low EmissionRenewable Energy Credit, and Zero Emission Renewable Energy Credit programsend on January 1, 2022. The existing net metering customers will begrandfathered until December 2039. Starting January 1, 2022, new customerswill be able to select a buy-all, sell-all option, or net billing option underthe new Net-Tariff program. The Public Utilities Regulator Authority (PURA)has finished implementing the new program as the Non-Residential RenewableEnergy Solutions Program. Residential customers can participate in theResidential Renewable Energy Solutions Program._**  The Non-Residential Renewable Energy Solutions (NRES) Program is a successorprogram to the Low Emission Renewable Energy Credit and Zero EmissionRenewable Energy Credit (LREC/ZREC) and Virtual Net Metering (VNM) programs,with the objectives to foster the sustained, orderly development of thestate’s Class I renewable energy industry and to encourage the participationby customers in underserved and environmental justice communities, amongothers. The program is authorized to run for six (6) years and to select up tosixty (60) MW of clean energy annually.This is a six-year program that combines the state's previous Net Meteringprogram and Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) payments into one program.Once a project has been approved, the incentive rate will not change for all20 years of the contract. Customers can choose from one of two tariffs. Thenetting tariff functions similarly to standard net metering: the customer'susage and generation is netted, after which the customer's bill is calculated.Under the buy-all tariff, the customer sells all of their generated energy tothe utility. Under both tariffs, all of a customer's generated RECs are soldto the utility. The following bid price caps rates will be in effect foreligible applications received in 2023:**** | **Buy-All Rates $/MWh** | **** |    ---|---|---|---    |  |  |  |    **Small** | $200.97 |  |  |    **Medium** | $190 |  |  |    **Large** | $159  |  |  |    **Low-Emission  ** | $159  |  |  |      The netting rate bid price cap is tied to the buy-all bid price caps. The sumof the net present value retail rate and the price per REC cannot exceed theequivalent buy-all cap for that size category. The precise calculation is:  Bid Price Cap ($/REC) + NPV Retail Rate ($MWh)2 £ Buy-All price cap, dependenton project category  $0/MWh £ Bid Price Cap ($/REC)    Small projects -- 0 to 200 kW -- are offered a standard contract with a setrate. Medium (200 kW to 1 MW), Large (1 to 5 MW), and Low-Emission (0 - 5 MW)projects are awarded incentive agreements through a competitive solicitationprocess. The upper size limit was originally 2 MW, but was increased to 5 MWby S.B. 176 in 2022.  The System Owner determines how the incentive will be divided between twocompensation options:> a) A monthly monetary on-bill credit that will be applied to the customer's> utility bill at the project site, and/or;> b) A quarterly direct payment provided to a Tariff Payment Beneficiary.  >In the buy-all structure, the payments can be divided between these twooptions, and the division percentages are selected at the time of bidsubmission. Payments are made at the bid price, and the bidder chooses thepercentage of that payment to be an on-bill credit vs. a quarterly directpayment. In the buy-all structure, the quarterly direct payments can be madeto the customer of record or a third party.    In the netting structure, bill credits are calculated using the bid “energy”price, and the quarterly direct payments to the tariff payment beneficiary arepaid at the bid “REC” price. The quarterly direct payments can be made to thecustomer of record or a third party.For more information, contact a Program Administrator, or view the FAQ here.   **Virtual Net Metering**    Connecticut allows virtual net metering for state, municipal, and agriculturalcustomers. A virtual net metering facility, must generate electricity usingeither Class I or Class III* resources from facilities of up to 3 MW. Systemscan be owned by the customer, leased by the customers, or owned by a third-party on a customer's property. The system may serve the electricity needs ofthe municipal host customer and additional beneficial accounts as long as thebeneficial accounts and host account are within the same electric distributioncompany's service territory. A municipal or state customer can host up to 5additional municipal or state accounts, and 5 additional non-state or-municipal buildings if those accounts are critical facilities** and connectedto a microgrid. An agricultural customer can host up to 10 beneficial accountsas long as those accounts either use electricity for agricultural purposes, orare municipal or noncommercial critical facilities. In addition, all virtualnet metering hosts can aggregate all of the meters owned by that customerhost.    If a host customer produces more electricity than it consumes, the excesselectricity will be credited to the beneficial accounts for the next billingperiod at the retail rate against the generation service component and adeclining percentage of the transmission and distribution charges that arebilled to the beneficial accounts. The declining percentages are as follows:    First year of commercial operation: 80% of transmission and distributioncharges  Second year of commercial operation: 60% of transmission and distributioncharges  Third year of commercial operation and after: 40% of transmission anddistribution charges.    Excess credits rollover monthly for one year. The electric distributioncompany is to compensate the municipal or state host customer for excessvirtual net metering credits remaining at the end of the calendar, if any, atthe retail generation rate and the above declining percentage of transmissionand distribution charges. HB 5496 enacted on June 2016 requires that thevirtual net metering facilities must be operational within 18 months from thedate Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) issues finalpermit.     _*Class III resources are defined as ""the electricity output from combinedheat and power systems with an operating efficiency level of no less thanfifty per cent that are part of customer-side distributed resources developedat commercial and industrial facilities in this state on or after January 1,2006, a waste heat recovery system installed on or after April 1, 2007, thatproduces electrical or thermal energy by capturing preexisting waste heat orpressure from industrial or commercial processes, or the electricity savingscreated in this state from conservation and load management programs begun onor after January 1, 2006.""    **Critical Facilities are defined as a hospital, police station, fire station,water treatment plant, sewage treatment plant, public shelter, correctionalfacility, production and transmission facilities of a television or radiostation, commercial area of a municipality, municipal center, or any otherarea identified by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection ascritical._",Net Metering,Regulatory Policy,1,https://portal.ct.gov/pura/electric/office-of-utility-programs-and-initiatives/clean-energy-programs/non-residential-renewable-energy-solutions-program,NA,2022
22455,District of Columbia,DC,Community Renewable Energy Amendment Act,"D.C. Act 20-196, enacted on December 13th 2013, established a communityrenewable energy program in the District of Columbia. This program sets aproduction capacity of 5MW on all systems, along with a minimum of two (2)subscribers. Community renewable energy facilities (CREF) may offset no morethan 120% of the subscriber's electricity consumption over the prior 12months. All individual billing meters must be within the District of Columbia.Credit rates will be applied to customer's each billing month, and will beallocated by multiplying the quantity of kilowatt hours allocated to eachsubscriber by the subscriber's CREF credit rate. The CREF credit rate is equalto to the standard offer service rate for the General Service Low Voltage Non-Demand Customer class or its successor, as determined by the Commission.

22457,Connecticut,CT,Shared Clean Energy Facility (SCEF) Program,"Residents or businesses can choose to invest in, or lease, a renewable energysystem installation on the rooftops of their homes or businesses, or on theirproperties. However, some Connecticut residents and businesses are either notable to, or elect not to, invest in or lease an individual propertyinstallation for a variety of reasons (e.g., high installation costs,unsuitable rooftop orientation, shaded property, or because they rent insteadof own their properties). Subscription to a shared clean energy facility(SCEF) provides an option that can be used to overcome such barriers, therebyexpanding access to renewable energy to more households and businesses in thestate. A SCEF enables multiple customers to benefit directly from thatfacility's energy production. The SCEF program is authorized by Public Act No.18-50 and allows Connecticut customers to participate in the renewables marketwhen their home or facility cannot support renewable energy production. TheSCEF program is a six-year competitive procurement program that will supportup to 150 MW of new clean power generation in Connecticut; Public Act No.22-14 expanded the program to 50 MW a year, up from 25 MW a year, creating anew program total of 225 MW.    Selected SCEF program generators will be provided with a 20-year tariff termfrom either Eversouce or United Illuminating (UI). SCEF projects will resultin credits that will be applied to the bills of participating electriccustomers at no cost to those customers.
