88,New Mexico,NM,Schools with Sol,"Schools with Sol is a four-year solar demonstration program of the EnergyConservation and Management Division for New Mexicoâ€™s K-12 schools. Theprogram funds the installation of solar equipment that produces electricityand/or hot water for school facilities. The goals are to create opportunitiesfor renewable energy education in New Mexicoâ€™s schools; provide residential-scale demonstrations in the schoolsâ€™ local communities; and displaceconventional electricity, natural gas, and propane consumption in schoolfacilities. Under the Schools with Sol program, solar energy systems are beinginstalled at ten sites in New Mexico schools each year from 2004 through 2007.It is estimated that the installed systems will produce more than 3 millionkilowatt-hours of energy during their 20-year life cycles and save $150,000 inenergy costs. As part of the Schools with Sol educational component, studentswill learn about PV and other types of renewable energy systems, and see real-time energy production through performance monitoring. Schools with Sol isfunded by the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department using StateGeneral Funds, U.S. Department of Energy funding, school district in-kindcontributions, and utility company funding. Funds are used for design,purchase, installation, and maintenance of solar systems. Through acompetitive process EMNRD selects schools each year to receive one of threetypes of systems: \- photovoltaic (PV), grid interconnected with 500-to-1000Watts; \- solar domestic hot water (SDHW), 30-to-120 square feet of liquidglazed collectors; \- solar swimming pool heating (SSPH), 200-to-300 squarefeet of liquid unglazed collectors. The Energy Conservation and ManagementDivision assists New Mexico public schools in reducing operating costs throughprograms for energy-efficient design, energy performance contracting, andclean energy grants. Schools with Sol offers an additional way to reduceoperating costs, while also providing a great educational opportunity forstudents to learn about solar energy and other sustainable technologies.",Grant Program,Financial Incentive,0,http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/emnrd/ecmd/SolSchools/SolSchools.htm,NA,NA,
222,New Mexico,NM,Fuel Mix and Emissions Disclosure,"The adoption of disclosure rules has been delayed, as the state legislaturevoted in early 2001 (SB 266) to delay restructuring until 2007. As part of NewMexicoâ€™s Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act of 1999, thelegislature requires the NM Public Regulation Commission (PRC) to ""promulgaterules governing competitive electric suppliers for the protection ofcustomers, including required disclosure to a potential customer of unbundledprices, generation sources and fuel mix, and associated emissions."" In May2000, the PRC issued proposed rules that would require environmentaldisclosure in a standard format at least once a year. The proposed rules wouldrequire information on fuel mix to be compared to the national and regionalaverages, based on data available for the most recent calendar year, except insome circumstances in which forecasted data could be used. Emissions of carbondioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury would be compared to theregional and national averages. The amount of spent nuclear fuel generatedwould also be disclosed. In all advertisements, competitive suppliers would berequired to include a toll free number and an Internet address through whichcustomers could obtain the disclosure label.

247,New Mexico,NM,System Benefits Charge,"**The New Mexico system benefits charge was replaced with the passing oftheEfficient Use of Energy Act. **  As part of New Mexico's Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act of 1999the legislature created the Electric Industry System Benefits Fund forrenewable energy, customer education, and low-income assistance. The fund iscreated through a charge of 0.03¢/kWh beginning January 1, 2002 and doublingin 2007. The charge is collected from all electric utilities, both private andpublic. The funds will support renewable energy up to $4 million to be used byschool districts, cities, towns, villages, or counties. Renewable technologiesto be supported include solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, landfill gas, andhydropower. Consumer education will be funded at $500,000 and overseen by thePublic Regulation Commission. Low-income energy assistance will be funded at$500,000 and provision of electricity to remote communities not connected tothe grid will be funded at up to $4,000,000.

284,New Mexico,NM,Net Metering,"**Eligibility and Availability**Net metering is available to all ""qualifying facilities"" (QFs), as defined bythe federal _Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978_ (PURPA), whichpertains to renewable energy systems and combined heat and power systems up to80 megawatts (MW) in capacity. There is no statewide cap on the aggregatecapacity of net-metered systems.All utilities subject to Public Regulation Commission (PRC) jurisdiction mustoffer net metering. (Municipal utilities, which are not regulated by the PRC,are exempt.) Customers are required to be billed for service in accordancewith the rate structure and monthly charges that the customer would beassigned if the customer had not interconnected a QF.**Net Excess Generation**  For net-metered systems 10 kilowatts (kW) or less, the utility has a choice inhow to compensate customers for net excess generation (NEG). The utility maycredit the customer on the next bill for the excess kilowatt-hours (kWh)generated, by either:  * Crediting or paying the customer for the NEG supplied to the utility at the utility's _energy rate_ (i.e., avoided cost rate); or,  * Crediting the customer for the kWh of NEG supplied to the utility. Unused credits are carried forward from month-to-month, provided that if a utility opts to credit customers and the customer leaves the system, the customer's unused credits for excess kWh generated are paid to the customer at the utility's _energy rate_. Utility-specific information on net metering can be found at the followingwebsites:  * PNM Resources (Public Service Company of NM) - Rider No. 24  * Xcel Energy (Southwestern Public Service Company) - Tariff No. 3018.33   * El Paso Electric Company - Rate No. 16For all other net-metered systems up to 80 MW, the NEG delivered from the QFto the utility is purchased by the utility at the utility's applicable time-of-use or single period _energy rate_. If a customer has NEG totaling lessthan $50 during a monthly billing period, the excess is carried over to thecustomer’s next monthly bill. If NEG exceeds $50 during a monthly billingperiod, the utility will pay the customer the following month for the excess.The energy rate to be paid for the energy supplied by the QF in any monthshall be the respective month's rate from the utility's current schedule onfile with the PRC. Each utility shall file with the PRC its schedulecontaining monthly energy rates that will be applicable to the next twelve-month period. Each month's energy rate contained in the schedule is theaverage of the economy energy purchases by the utility for the correspondingmonth of the immediately preceding 12-month period. The energy rate containedin the schedules is required to include the savings attributable to theavoidance of losses due to transmission, distribution, and transformation asapplicable for different voltage levels of interconnection.Utilities with retail time-of-use rates on file with the PRC must fileschedules reflecting monthly energy rates calculated for peak periods only andoff-peak periods only which shall be applied to QFs whose generation islimited to peak periods only or off-peak periods only.**Interconnection**The PRC adopted revised interconnection standards for customer-sitedgenerators in July 2008.If provision of the net metering option requires metering equipment andrelated facilities that are more costly than would otherwise be necessaryabsent the requirement for net metering, the QF must pay all incremental costsassociated with installing the more costly metering equipment and facilities.The QF must give the utility at least 60 days written advance notice tointerconnect, and the utility must specify within 15 days the reason(s) why itcannot interconnect as requested if it is unable to do so. Within 10 days ofreceiving notification of the intent to interconnect from a customer with a QF10 kW or less in size, the utility must notify the customer of any meteringcosts.",Net Metering,Regulatory Policy,1,NA,NA,NA,
290,New Mexico,NM,New Mexico Solar Easements & Rights Laws,"New Mexico's Solar Rights Act (1977) and Solar Recordation Act (1983) allowproperty owners to create solar easements for the purpose of protecting andmaintaining proper access to sunlight. The Solar Rights Act established theright to use solar energy as a property right. The solar right preventsneighboring property owners from constructing new buildings or planting newtrees which would block their access to the sun.The Solar Recordation Act describes the procedures for filing a solar rightthrough the County Clerk's Office. The property owner seeking the solar rightmust give advanced notice to the adjacent property owners, who are entitled tocontest the claim. Once awarded, the solar right is attached to the propertyand will remain in effect even if the property is sold. The solar right,however, can be bought and sold separately from the property. This allows aneighboring property owner to purchase the solar right and then cancel it. TheSolar Rights Act and the Solar Recordation Act also include provisionsallowing local governments to create their own ordinances or zoning rulespertaining to the protection of solar rights.In May 2007, S.B. 1031 strengthened solar access rights in New Mexico bylimiting the ability of a county or municipality to restrict the placement ofsolar collectors unless the location is within a historic district. S.B. 1031also voided all covenants and restrictions (from July 1, 1978 forward) thateffectively prohibit the installation of solar collectors.More information is available in this brochure and at the website listedabove.",Solar/Wind Access Policy,Regulatory Policy,1,http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/ECMD/RenewableEnergy/solar.html,NA,1983,

359,New Mexico,NM,Biomass Equipment & Materials Compensating Tax Deduction,"In 2005, New Mexico adopted a policy to allow businesses to deduct the valueof biomass equipment and biomass materials used for the processing ofbiopower, biofuels, or biobased products in determining the amount ofCompensating Tax due.New Mexico's Compensating Tax is an excise, or ""use"" tax, which is typicallylevied on the purchaser of the product or service for using tangible propertyin the state. The tax applies to imports of factory and office equipment, andother items. The rate is 5.125% on certain property used in New Mexico and 5%on certain services used in New Mexico. Compensating Tax is designed toprotect New Mexico businesses from unfair competition from out-of-statebusiness not subject to a sales or gross receipts tax. This biomassCompensating Tax deduction is analogous to a sales tax exemption for renewableenergy equipment available in some other states.Deductions from compensating tax do not have to be reported to the New MexicoTaxation and Revenue Department but records substantiating the deductionshould be kept in the taxpayer's records.",Sales Tax Incentive,Financial Incentive,1,NA,06/17/2005,2005,

720,New Mexico,NM,Renewable Portfolio Standard,"In March 2004, New Mexico’s governor signed into law the _Renewable EnergyAct_ (S.B. 43), creating a state renewable portfolio standard (RPS). By 2020,investor-owned utilities (IOUs) are required to generate 20% of total retailsales from renewable energy resources, and rural electric cooperatives arerequired to generate 10% of total retail sales from renewable energyresources. This requirement was later increased by S.B. 489 of 2019.  **Eligible Technologies**Renewable energy is defined as electric energy generated by low- or zero-emissions generation technology with substantial long-term productionpotential; solar; wind; geothermal; hydropower facilities brought in serviceafter July 1, 2007; fuel cells that are not fossil fueled; and biomassresources, such as agriculture or animal waste, small diameter timber, saltcedar, and other phreatophyte or woody vegetation removed from river basins orwatersheds in New Mexico, landfill gas, and anaerobically digested wastebiomass. Distribution cooperatives may count energy produced by geothermalheat pumps towards their requirements, per H.B. 263 enacted in April 2015.The statute explicitly states that renewable energy does not include electricenergy generated from fossil fuels or nuclear facilities.**Requirements**IOUs and rural distribution cooperatives are required to generate 20% of totalretail sales from renewable energy resources by 2020, increasing to 40% by2025, and 50% by 2030. After 2030, New Mexico utilities must continue totransition to carbon free resources. By 2040 80% of the retail sales ofelectricity by just IOUs must come from renewable energy resources. However,through 2047, utilities are not required to displace any zero carbon resourcesto comply with the standard. By 2045, zero carbon resources must supply 100%of all retail sales from IOUs. Rural distribution cooperatives have a targetof zero-carbon by 2050, composed of at least 80% renewable energy.Rural electric distribution cooperatives are required to have renewable energyaccount for 5% of retail sales in 2015, increasing at a rate of 1% annuallyuntil January 1, 2020, at which time the RPS is 10%. S.B. 489 of 2019 addedadditional requirements for later years of 40% by 2025 and 50% by 2030. By2050, zero-carbon resources must supply 100% of all retail sales; 80% mustcome from renewable energy sources. The 2050 is applicable only if 1) thetarget is technically feasible, 2) the cooperative can still provide reliableelectric service while implementing the target, and 3) implementing the targetwill not cause electric service to become unaffordable.  **Credit Multiplier**Each kWh of renewable energy generation by solar technologies that weredeveloped and operational before January 1, 2012, by a distributioncooperative or through the wholesale contract obligation of the wholesalesupplier counts as 3.0 kWh for RPS compliance purposes.**Compliance**Utilities document compliance with the RPS through the use of renewable energycertificates (RECs). A REC represents all of the environmental attributes from1 kWh of electricity generated from a renewable energy resource. RECs used forRPS compliance on or after January 1, 2008, must be registered with theWestern Renewable Energy Generation Information System (WREGIS). RECs that arenot used for compliance, sold, or otherwise transferred may be carried forwardfor up to 4 years.Each year on May 1, June 1, or July 1 (depending on the IOU), an IOU mustsubmit a procurement plan for the upcoming 2 years to the PRC. Thisprocurement plan report describes the procurement and generation of renewableenergy for the upcoming plan year and a suggested procurement plan for thefollowing year. The PRC order approving the procurement plan only reflects theprocurement for the upcoming plan year, however. At the same time, each IOU isrequired to submit an annual renewable energy portfolio report on the previouscalendar year, describing actual retail sales and subsequent reductions due toRCT, large customers, or exempt customers as well as actual procurement.Electric cooperatives must report to the PRC annually by April 30 on itspurchases and generation of renewable energy during the preceding calendaryear.**Cost Mitigation Measures**_**Investor-Owned Utilities**_This RPS compliance requirement may be adjusted for the following threereasons.First, provisions in current law limit the potential cost of complying withthe RPS. In any given year, if the cost to procure renewable energy is greaterthan the _reasonable cost threshold (RCT)_ , a public utility may reduce itsprocurement down to the RCT percentage level. However, the condition excusingperformance under the RPS in any given year may not serve as an excuse todelay procurement of sufficient resources to meet the increasing RPScompliance requirements in future years. As of 2013, the RCT threshold is 3%of retail sales.Second, the large customer cap also constrains the amount of renewable energythat can be procured. For non-governmental customers who consume more than 10million kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, renewable energy procurement is limitedso as not to exceed either 2% of the customer’s annual electric charges or$99,000, whichever is less. After January 1, 2012, the $99,000 limit isinflation-adjusted by the amount of the cumulative change in the ConsumerPrice Index, Urban (CPI-U) between January 1, 2011, and January 1 of theprocurement plan year.Third, the Renewable Energy Act (Chapter 62, Article 16 NMSA 1978) was amendedin 2014 (effective May 15, 2014) to exempt any political subdivision of NM orany educational institution with a fall semester enrollment of at leasttwenty-four thousand students provided they met the following criteria: (i)has an excess of 20,000,000 kWh of electricity consumption at a singlelocation or facility, regardless of how many meters it has; (ii) has its owncapacity to generate renewable energy; and (iii) certifies that it will spend2.5% of the annual electricity charges to further develop customer-ownedrenewable energy generation._**Electric Cooperatives**_The RCT for cooperatives is 1% of its gross receipts from business transactedin New Mexico for the preceding calendar year. Cooperatives are not requiredto incur RPS compliance costs above this level. These levels were establishedin S.B. 418 (March 2007).In addition, S.B. 418 established a “renewable energy and conservation fee” tosupport programs or projects to promote the use of renewable energy, loadmanagement, or energy efficiency. Distribution cooperatives may collect fromits customers a fee of no more than one percent of the customer’s bill, not toexceed $75,000 annually from any single customer.",Renewables Portfolio Standard,Regulatory Policy,1,http://www.nmprc.state.nm.us/utilities/renewable-energy.html,NA,2004,
728,New Mexico,NM,Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit (Corporate),"** _Note: The tax credits are fully subscribed. As of July 2016, there were973 MW (2,148,000 MWh) of projects in the waiting queue for the wind/biomasstax credit and 1,103 MW (2,369,000 MWh) of projects in the waiting queue forthe solar tax credit._**Enacted in 2002, the New Mexico Renewable Energy Production Tax Creditprovides a tax credit against personal or corporate income tax. To qualify, anenergy generator must have a capacity of at least 1 megawatt and be installedbefore January 2018.  **Amount**  The tax credit is $0.01 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for companies that generateelectricity from wind or biomass. Companies that generate electricity fromsolar energy receive a tax incentive that varies annually according to thefollowing schedule:    * Year 1: $0.015 per kWh    * Year 2: $0.02 per kWh  * Year 3: $0.025 per kWh  * Year 4: $0.03 per kWh  * Year 5: $0.035 per kWh  * Year 6: $0.04 per kWh  * Year 7: $0.035 per kWh  * Year 8: $0.03 per kWh  * Year 9: $0.025 per kWh  * Year 10: $0.02 per kWhAccording to the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, thisincentive averages $0.027 per kWh annually.For wind and biomass generators, the credit is applicable only to the first400,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity in each of 10 consecutive taxableyears. For solar, the credit is applicable only to the first 200,000 MWh ofelectricity in each taxable year.  **Aggregate Cap**  Total generation from both the corporate and personal tax credit programscombined must not exceed 2,000,000 MWh of production annually, plus anadditional 500,000 MWh produced by solar energy. Taxpayers cannot claim boththe corporate and the personal tax credit for the same renewable energysystem.   **Excess Tax Credits**  For electricity generated prior to October 1, 2007, excess credit may becarried forward for up to 5 consecutive taxable years. For electricitygenerated on or after October 1, 2007, excess credit shall be refunded to thetaxpayer in order to allow project owners with limited tax liability to fullyutilize the credit.",Corporate Tax Credit,Financial Incentive,0,http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/ecmd/CleanEnergyTaxIncentives/ProdTaxCredit.html,07/01/2002,2002,
798,New Mexico,NM,Interconnection Standards,"Interconnection in New Mexico is governed by New Mexico Public RegulationCommission (PRC) Rule 570 and Rule 571. Rule570 applies to all qualifyingfacilities (QFs) under PURPA, which generally includes all renewable-energysystems and combined-heat-and-power (CHP) systems up to 80 megawatts (MW) incapacity. All utilities subject to PRC jurisdiction must offer net meteringand must comply with certain interconnection standards. (Municipal utilities,which are not regulated by the commission, are exempt.) Rule 571, adopted inSeptember 1999, applies to small renewable-energy systems and CHP systems upto 10 kilowatts (kW) in capacity. The purpose of Rule 571 is to simplify theinterconnection requirements for QFs up to 10 kW and to encourage the use ofsmall-scale, customer-owned renewable or alternative-energy resources. Therule includes a standard interconnection agreement. Systems must comply withall local and national standards, including the NEC, IEEE and UL, and mustalso meet any additional requirements approved by the PRC. Net metering isaccomplished using a single, bi-directional meter. A manual externaldisconnect device is required unless the customer and utility agree that themeter can be used to disconnect the system in the case of a power outage.While it is not mandatory, the PRC strongly recommends that a customerpurchase liability insurance, and may require the customer to do so at theutility's request. As a practical matter, PV interconnection in New Mexico isa straightforward process. Most utilities allow the meter to serve as theexternal disconnect. The only testing required is a simple shut-down test toensure that systems recognize when the power grid is down. Rule 570,established to comply with PURPA for QFs up to 80 MW in capacity, addressesthe legal, technical and buy-back rate issues for these larger systems. ThePRC extended the availability of net metering to QFs up to 80 MW in January2007. As part of its January 2007 revisions to Rule 570, the PRC developed astandard interconnection agreement for systems up to 100 kW. Systems must meetutility safety standards, and system owners must pay appropriate""interconnection costs,"" as defined in the rule. All QFs are ""stronglyencouraged to obtain liability insurance."" A utility may require QFs largerthan 50 kW to obtain general liability insurance not to exceed $1 million.Customers must pay demand charges and other charges in accordance withapplicable tariffs, and for any incremental costs associated with installingnecessary metering equipment and facilities. Furthermore, an additionalcustomer charge to cover the added costs of billing and administration may beincluded in a utility's tariff if supported with evidence of need for such acharge. In January 2007, the PRC initiated a proceeding to consider newinterconnection standards and procedures for QFs, with the IEEE 1547 standardforming the basis of the commission's technical interconnection standard. ThePRC also will consider a standard set of procedures to streamline theinterconnection process between a utility and all customer-owned generationfacilities.",Interconnection,Regulatory Policy,0,NA,NA,1999,
866,New Mexico,NM,Mandatory Utility Green Power Option,"**Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs)**In addition to meeting the requirements of the state renewable portfoliostandard, New Mexico's IOUs are required to offer customers a voluntaryprogram for purchasing renewable energy. The voluntary renewable energy tariffmay also allow consumers to purchase renewable energy within certain energyblocks and by source of renewable energy. IOUs are also required to develop aneducational program communicating the benefits and availability of the greenpower option.The three IOUs that serve New Mexico customers offer the following programs:_El Paso Electric (EPE)_EPE’s voluntary renewable energy program is called the “Renewable EnergyTariff Program.” It uses wind power from EPE’s Hueco Mountain Wind Ranch nearHorizon, Texas. Customers can purchase energy blocks of 100 kilowatt-hours(kWh). The monthly costs per customer class are as follows: $5.84(Residential), $4.26 (small commercial), and $5.48-$5.61 (commercial, generalservice)._Public Service Company of NM (PNM)_PNM’s program is called “Sky Blue.” The electricity that is part of thisprogram is generated from wind (85%) and solar (15%). The wind is generated atthe NM Wind Energy Center close to Fort Sumner, New Mexico and the sun from22,000 solar panels in central New Mexico near Los Lunas. PNM offers twooptions for participating in Sky Blue: (i) buy 100 kWh blocks of electricityfor a monthly cost of $1.70 more than the customer’s normal electricity chargeor (ii) purchase Sky Blue kWh as a percentage (between 1% and 85%) of one’sregular monthly electricity cost with a cost of $0.017 per kWh used additionalabove regular electricity charge. The first option adds a fixed charge to themonthly bill while the second option adds a variable charge since it is basedon a percentage.For more information, visit the PNM program website._Southwestern Public Service (SPS)_SPS’s program is called “Windsource®.” The energy is generated from wind farmsin eastern New Mexico. Similar to PNM, there are two options that involve afixed monthly charge for a premium of $3.17 per 100 kWh block for residentialcustomers, $3.00 per 100 kWh block for commercial customers, or a variablemonthly charge for up to 100% of a customer’s electricity use (~$25.36 monthextra on the electric bill for the average Xcel Energy residential customer).For more information, visit the SPS program website.**Rural Electric Distribution Cooperatives**The state's rural electric distribution cooperatives are also required tooffer a voluntary green power program if their suppliers make such renewableresources available under their supply contracts.

For more detailed information about buildingenergy codes, visit the DOE and BCAP websites._    All residential and commercial structures are required to comply with thestate’s energy code. The 2009 New Mexico Energy Conservation Code (NMECC),effective June 2013, is based on 2009 International Energy Conservation Code.One amendment in NMECC to the 2009 IECC established climate zones to determineapplicable building efficiency requirements based on geographic location andaltitude.The state also traditionally adopts the current version of the InternationalConference of Building Officials (ICBO) Uniform Building Codes as a basis forall building codes. These codes are adopted by the state on a 3-year codecycle corresponding with the publication of the ICBO Uniform Codes.Amendments, if any, to the current version of the NMECC must first be proposedby a trade association or other construction group.    Notably, the residential code includes a requirement for new residentialconstruction to account for the possibility of a solar system being installedin the future (see H.B. 610). New construction must include an electricalraceway connecting a future solar installation site with a future electricalequipment site.The NMECC specifies compliance and plan review requirements. The localjurisdiction generally regulates plan review and enforcement (when they electto enforce the code).

1908,New Mexico,NM,Energy Efficiency Standards for State Buildings,"On January 16th, 2006, the governor of New Mexico signed Executive Order2006-001, calling for all Executive Branch state agencies, including theHigher Education Department, to adopt the US Green Buildings Council's LEED*rating system. New construction of public buildings over 15,000 square feet orusing over 50 kW peak electrical demand and renovations involving thereplacement of more than 3 major systems (HVAC, lighting, etc.) must achieve aminimum rating of LEED ""Silver"". Projects between 5,000 and 15,000 square feetmust achieve a minimum delivered energy performance standard of one half ofthe US energy consumption for that building type as defined by the USDepartment of Energy. All other new construction, renovations, repairs, andreplacements of state buildings must employ cost-effective, energy efficient,green building practices to the maximum extent possible.    Furthermore, the act ordered that the Energy, Minerals, and Natural ResourceDepartment (EMNRD) convene a Public Schools Clean Energy Task Force to makerecommendations to ""implement aggressive energy efficiency measures"" in allexisting and newly constructed school buildings.    Executive Order 2007-053, established further energy saving goals forExecutive Branch agencies in New Mexico, as well as the state as a whole. TheOrder set a goal of a 20% reduction below 2005 energy consumption levels forall Executive Branch agencies by 2015. The reduction will be based on theaverage energy usage per square foot of building space. Similarly, allExecutive Branch agencies must reduce the energy usage of their fleets by 20%by 2015 relative to 2005 levels, and based on the average energy usage perstate employee. The state-wide target is for a 20% reduction in per capitaenergy use across all sectors from 2005 levels by 2020, with an interim goalof 10% by 2012. Other provisions in the Executive Order deal with tracking,reporting and other administrative responsibilities related to these goals.    While the Executive Orders generally affect Executive Branch agencies only, SB200 of 2010 established a wider building requirement for certain buildingprojects throughout the state that receive state funding. New buildings andbuilding additions of 3,000 square feet or more, and buildings undergoingcertain system renovations must be designed and constructed to attain EnergyStar certification. SB 200 also provides exemptions to the requirement forhistoric buildings and projects where the costs of compliance would exceed theestimated life-cycle savings of the project.      _*Clickhere for more information on the United States Green Building Council'sLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building RatingSystem._",Energy Standards for Public Buildings,Regulatory Policy,0,http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/ECMD/GovernmentLeadByExample/governmentleadbyexample.htm,NA,2007,

Commercial PACE programs werenot directly affected by FHFA’s actions, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do notunderwrite commercial mortgages. Visit PACENation for more information aboutPACE financing and a comprehensive list of all PACE programs across thecountry._**  Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing effectively allows propertyowners to borrow money to pay for energy improvements. The amount borrowed istypically repaid via a special assessment on the property over a period ofyears. In 2009 New Mexico enacted two separate bills authorizing localgovernments to offer these types of programs using different mechanisms. (Notall local governments in New Mexico offer PACE financing; contact your localgovernment to find out if it has established a PACE financing program.)**Renewable Energy Financing District Act**New Mexico enacted S.B. 647 in 2009, which authorizes municipalities andcounties to create renewable energy financing districts (REFD) for the purposeof providing financing for consenting property owners within the district toinstall renewable energy technologies. Eligible technologies includephotovoltaics, solar thermal, geothermal, and wind.A county is authorized to create a REFD in both its unincorporated andincorporated areas (provided that the county receives the consent of theimpacted municipalities in an incorporated area). A municipality may create aREFD within its borders.Municipalities and counties must follow the same process for establishing aREFD. First, it must draft and adopt a resolution that includes specificdetails of the district, such as the types of renewable energy technologies tobe included. After passing the resolution, the county or municipality musthold a public hearing and solicit feedback from stakeholders. Finally, afterconsidering the opinions and comments, it is required to establish the REFD byway of ordinance. Once the district is formed, individual property owners mayopt in to participate per the terms of the program. Any financing a propertyowner receives is repaid as an assessment on their property tax and will be asenior lien on the property until fully repaid. The district may issue bondsto fund financing programs and the standards for the district board’s rolesand powers.Each district will be governed by a district board of five members. Thesemembers may be from the local government or individuals appointed by the localgovernment (either way, the makeup of the board must be specified in theresolution and subsequent ordinance).**Solar Energy Improvement Special Assessment Act**    New Mexico also enacted H.B. 572 in 2009, which authorizes a county to pass anordinance that creates a “solar energy improvement special assessment”provision. The county itself is not authorized to provide funding directly toproperty owners; rather, it creates rules for certifying certain private banksand financing institutions as “solar energy improvement financinginstitutions.”Solar energy improvement financing institutions are authorized to loanproperty owners up to 40% of the assessed value of the property for purposesof solar energy (photovoltaic or solar thermal) improvements. The propertyowner will enter into a direct agreement with a certified financialinstitution for the funding and they will be required to apply to the countyas well, since the loan through the private institution will be paid via anassessment on their property tax and will constitute a lien on the property.The county devises the process for transferring funds collected via thespecial assessment to the participating financial institution. No county mypass an ordinance that contains additional provisions to those outlined in thelaw (e.g., an ordinance may not require property owners to receive an energyaudit as a condition of participation).",PACE Financing,Financial Incentive,1,http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/ECMD/CleanEnergyTaxIncentives/PACE.html,NA,2009,

4494,New Mexico,NM,Energy Efficiency Resource Standard,"**Origin**In 2008, New Mexico enacted H.B. 305, the Efficient Use of Energy Act, whichcreated an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS) for New Mexico’selectric utilities, and a requirement that all natural gas utilities pursueall cost-effective energy efficiency and demand-side management measures. In2013, the compromise bill H.B. 267—which had revised the original standard of10% of 2005 retail sales by 2020 down to 8%—also changed the cost-effectiveness test from Total Resource Cost test (TRC) to the Utility CostTest (UCT).**Electric Sales Reduction**Year |  Requirement (Cumulative % of 2005 Sales)  ---|---  2010-2014 |  Amounts Leading to 5%  2014-2020 |  >5%  2020 and After |  >8%    Investor-owned utilities are required to offer demand-side management and loadmanagement programs to their customers under the Efficient Use of Energy Act(EUEA). The programs must be designed to achieve electricity savings totaling5% of 2005 retail sales by 2014 and 8% of 2005 retail sales by 2020.Distribution cooperative utilities, which are not regulated by the PublicRegulation Commission (PRC), are required to develop their own self-imposedelectricity reduction targets and to design demand-side management programs toenable them to meet those targets. Each cooperative utility must submit areport to the PRC annually describing their demand side management effortsfrom the previous year.Per the EUEA, rural electric distribution cooperative utilities must developtheir own self-imposed energy efficiency and load management goals and designprograms to meet those goals. Under the law, the cooperatives are not requiredto submit their energy efficiency programs to the PRC for approval; eachcooperative’s governing board shall approve their menu of programs. However,the cooperatives must file annual reports with the commission that describethe portfolio of energy efficiency programs, the costs, and the energyreductions achieved pursuant to the EUEA.**Program Administrator Type**New Mexico’s utilities administer the programs that provide the energy savingsnecessary for compliance with the Energy Efficiency Resource Standard.**Cost-Effectiveness and Program Evaluation**To evaluate the cost effectiveness of its efficiency and demand reductionactivities, New Mexico utilizes the Utility Cost Test (UCT) as its primarytest for measuring the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. Priorto the passage of H.B. 267, New Mexico utilized the Total Resource Cost test(TRC).**Utility Cost Recovery Provisions**The Efficient Use of Energy Act allows New Mexico’s public utilities that meetthe standard to receive a financial incentive on their energy efficiency anddemand-side management program efforts that partially decouples their revenuesfrom their sales of electricity. Public Service Company of New Mexico and ElPaso Electric receive financial incentives as a percentage share of theirprogram costs. Southwest Public Service receives an incentive on its programcosts that is conditional on several highly specific aspects of programperformance. Distribution cooperative utilities may recover their coststhrough general rates.**Special Provisions (Self-Direction of Program Funds and Customer CostLimits)**Large energy users that consume more than 7,000 MWh per year in the serviceterritories of New Mexico’s public utilities are eligible to offset up to 70%of the amount they would pay to public utilities with investments in energyefficiency and demand-side management programs that they have invested in onor after January 1, 2005. The ability to self-direct program funds ispermitted for no more than 2 years at a time, and must be accompanied byengineering studies that show that the user has exhausted all efforts topursue cost-effective efficiency and demand-side management projects at theirfacilities.The law also requires gas utilities to ""acquire all cost-effective andachievable energy efficiency and load management resources"" through anidentical surcharge, but stops short of establishing a percentage-basedsavings target for them. To fund energy efficiency and demand-side managementprograms, electric and gas utilities are entitled to apply a surcharge tocustomer utility bills. Total program budgets are not to exceed the amount ofthe lessor of 3% of all customer bills, or of $75,000 per year per customer.If a utility finds that they cannot meet the 5% and 8% electricity savingstargets, they will report to the PRC and propose a new target based on whatthey determine to be their maximum cost-effective savings. If the PRC agreeswith the utility, they may establish new, lower targets for the utility. UnderH.B. 267, New Mexico’s utilities are not permitted to spend more than 3% oftheir revenue on energy efficiency and demand-side management programs,excluding taxes and fees on electric service.",Energy Efficiency Resource Standard,Regulatory Policy,1,http://www.nmprc.state.nm.us/utilities/energy-efficiency.html,NA,2008,
